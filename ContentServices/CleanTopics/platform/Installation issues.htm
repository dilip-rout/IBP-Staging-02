    <body>When the Platform installer is running, it logs messages to the standard output stdoutXXX.log file (or hostname.XXX.log) in the Tomcat log directory (if Tomcat is running as a service) or to the application's terminal window. For normal, error-free startup you should see output similar to the following (omitting some Tomcat-generated messages): ==&gt;&gt; Master Server is starting ROLLBASE_HOME=c:\rollbase\shared Host name: localhost:8080 Release: 4.07 Master Server: Initialization completed successfully ==&gt;&gt; PROD1 Server is starting Production Server PROD1: Initialization completed successfully ==&gt;&gt; REST server is starting ==&gt;&gt; Router Server is starting ==&gt;&gt; SEARCH Server is starting ==&gt;&gt; STORAGE Server is starting ==&gt;&gt; WEBAPI Server is starting These log messages are important for diagnosing installation and setup issues. Please include them in any support request related to Platform Private Cloud installation. If you encountered an error during installation, cannot start or login into your Platform server, the following issues could exist: Issue Resolution The ROLLBASE_HOME environment variable is not set or is pointing to the wrong directory. Make sure that the ROLLBASE_HOME environment variable is set and pointing to the correct directory. See Set environment variables The Tomcat server was not stopped while WAR files were copied by you or the installer into the Tomcat webapps directory. Stop Tomcat, delete the files from the Web server deployment directory, as well as temporary files which may have been created, including JSP cache files from the working folder), recopy the WAR files and restart Tomcat. The host name specified in the System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties, node-config.json configuration file and System Console &gt; System &gt; Components configuration files does not match the actual host name you're using. Update the Shared Properties, Components and node-config.json configuration file with the correct host name. The Shared Properties contains invalid email credentials Update the configuration file with valid email credentials. The version date of rb_util.jar in the Tomcat lib directory is inconsistent with the version and or date of the Platform WAR files. If you installed manually, confirm that you unzipped the Platform lib.zip into the Tomcat lib directory. Database issues Drop the rb_dbo table by running the SQL command: drop database rb_dbo; The WebAPI server is not running when you are logged into the Master Server and viewing Platform Private Cloud component status. Delete the Tomcat webapps/webapi directory and restart Tomcat. If problems persist, feel free to use the Platform forum to ask questions and interact with other customers. However, if the problem is related to the specifics of your local environment, you will probably need to involve your IT staff.</body>
