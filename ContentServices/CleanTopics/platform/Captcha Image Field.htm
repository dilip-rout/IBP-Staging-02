    <body>The Captcha Image Field type requires that the user type letters and digits displayed in a distorted image to ensure that the user is in fact a human, rather than a computer. Form submission will not work if the entry is not correct. For example, the figure below shows how a Captcha Image might appear in a Portal Page. See Platform portals for more information.</body>
