    <body>Purpose Performs a user log in and initiates a SOAP API session. Either this method or login2() (see below) must be called prior to any other API call. The customer tenant to login is determined by the login name. The Web API login creates a server-side session which might expire according to the security level set for the customer tenant (see Security and Access Control for more information). The API client should re-login if the session expires. Infinite Blue recommends that an API client logs out after performing a group of operations instead of keeping the API session open for a long time. When an API client logs in, all sessions with the same user credentials are terminated. Subsequent API calls that use a session ID are considered to be made on behalf of the logged in user. That user's permissions are checked for each subsequent call. For example, to update a record a logged in user must have sufficient permissions or the API call will fail. Syntax login(string loginName, string password); Parameters loginName String containing login name for an active Platform user account password String containing user password Output Session ID that must be used in all subsequent API calls during this session</body>
