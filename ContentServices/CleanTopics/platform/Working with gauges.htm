    <body>You can use a gauge in Platform to visually represent a single numeric value computed using a JavaScript formula. Gauges resemble familiar devices such as a car's speedometer or an electronic scale. Platform supports several different gauge types for various visual effects. Gauges can periodically and automatically refresh themselves without a complete page refresh.</body>
