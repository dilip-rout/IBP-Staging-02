This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose After applying the specified filter condition, retrieves the number of records in a view that meet that condition. Syntax rbf_getCount2(viewId, filterName, filterValue, callback, useLegacyDateFormat) Parameters viewId The original ID of the view filterName Name of the filter added to existing filters. filterValue The value of the field to filter output using "equals". callback A function to process the specified operation and receive its result, in the XML
format, as the first argument. useLegacyDateFormat This optional parameter only applies to JSON output and, specifically, to Date and Date/Time fields. If true, or if not specified, a date value is returned as a Date object. If false, a date value is returned as a String. Note: This API is supported in portals as well. Example The following example prints the number of records whose city = Austin to the console. function my_callback(count) { console.log("Count is: " + count); } rbf_getCount2(7633, "city", "Austin", my_callback);</body>
