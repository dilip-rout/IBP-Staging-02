    <body>Masses of data can be overwhelming and difficult to manage. Applications that meet real user needs will likely contain logic that transforms raw data into accessible information and supports business processes. Platform offers a variety of built-in mechanisms that simplify the addition of business logic. These include templates, formulas, workflows, and triggers. Since each application is unique, this documentation describes the available features and provides examples. Infinite Blue recommends that you acquaint yourself with Platform capabilities and the examples and then apply the principles to your use case. See Adding business logic for detailed descriptions of templates, formulas, triggers, and workflows. Watch a short video that demonstrates basic customization: An overview of application customization . The end-user experience is shaped both by business logic and by presentation. When you create application objects, Platform creates a basic interface for creating, updating, and deleting records. You can edit these pages to customize what they contain and their look and feel. The topics in this section provide an overview of Platform user interface components. See Customizing the user experience for more details.</body>
