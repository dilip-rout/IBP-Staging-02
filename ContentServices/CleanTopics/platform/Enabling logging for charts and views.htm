    <body>Administrators of the master tenant can enable logging to debug charts and views for a customer tenant. The log will contain SQL statements and results to help with troubleshooting. Note: Logging is limited to only one chart or view at a time. If logging is enabled one one chart or view, and you enable logging on a second chart or view, the setting on the first one is automatically disabled. Reviewers: From the description of PSC00308457, it wasn't clear to me whether the restriction is one chart or one view, or one chart and one view. I wrote it as the former. To enable logging for a chart or view, follow these steps: Navigate to the customer record for the tenant and click Login. In the customer tenant, navigate to the object definition that contains the chart or view. Navigate to the Charts or Views section. Click Edit next to the chart or view. The Edit page opens: Scroll down to the Debug section: Select the check box Log all SQL queries created by this &lt;View or Chart&gt; in query.log. Click Save. After exercising the view or chart, for example, by creating a new record, return to the edit page where you enabled logging and click query.log to open the log file.</body>
