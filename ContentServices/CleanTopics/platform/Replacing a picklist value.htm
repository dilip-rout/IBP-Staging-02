    <body>If you need to change a value in a picklist, do not directly edit that value in the picklist field. If you do so, Platform will delete the old value and create a new value. In this case, existing records that use the old value lose the value in that field. To preserve existing values, use the Replace action as follows: In the Fields section of the object definition, click Replace. The Replace Picklist Value dialog opens. On the Replace Picklist Value dialog, select the value to replace and enter the new value. This will replace the old value in all existing records with the new value you define. Click Save.</body>
