    <body>A wildcard character search is a placeholder that searches one or more characters. Wildcards can also be combined with other characters to create a search pattern. Platform supports single and multiple character wildcard character searches: To perform a single wildcard character search, use the "?" symbol. To perform a multiple wildcard character search, use the "*" symbol. The single wildcard character search looks for terms that match those with the single character replaced. For example, to search for text or test you can use the search: te?t Multiple wildcard character search looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search: test* You can also use the wildcard character search in the middle of a term: te*t Note: You cannot use a "*" or "?" symbol as the first character of a search.
