    <body>After installing Platform Private Cloud and performing the steps described in Starting Private Cloud Components , you can begin using the master tenant. From the master tenant, administrative users can set up and manage customer tenants and the Platform system. The topics in this section provide an overview of administration and describe how to perform common tasks. The procedures described in this section are the same for single server and multi-server environments. However, to have access to full administrative capabilities, you need to log in to the master tenant. Development sandboxes and production tenants Infinite Blue recommends that Private Cloud installations have at least one customer tenant to use as a sandbox for development and testing. To set this up, create a Customer object and add developers as users. Once applications are ready, you can use the XML publishing mechanism or the Application Directory or Marketplace portal to distribute applications to other customer tenants.</body>
