    <body>You can easily test your Platform application as you build it by switching between application interface and setup pages. The applications, pages and controls that end-users see depend on the user's role and permissions. To experience the application as end-users will experience it, you can create test user accounts. You set up a user account by creating a new User record for that user. The User object is a built-in component of the Platform application. You can add the User object to your application for convenience. Platform provides several built-in roles, including Administrator. You can create roles specific to a particular application. The Role object is also a built-in object, but is only available from administrative setup. See Role-based access control for more details. To create a User record for testing, you will need an email address that differs from the associated with your Platform account. You can create several to test using different combinations of roles and permissions.</body>
