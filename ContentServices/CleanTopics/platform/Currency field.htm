    <body>With the Currency field type, users can enter a dollar or other currency amount. You can optionally define the following properties: Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Default Size — The default size of the input field shown in forms (you can override this default as a page-level property using the page editor). Currency Format — This setting affects the formatting of the field. See Currency formats for supported currency formats. Default Value — Assign a Default Value to the field and select the Assign values for all existing object records now check box when creating the field. Note: The setting only applies to new fields. If you update an existing field by adding a default value, existing records will not be updated with the Default Value . Minimum Value — Minimum allowed value for this field. . Maximum Value — Maximum allowed value for this field. . Advanced Field Properties — For more information, see Advanced field properties . Integration Name — The integration name is used to reference this field via merge fields or with Platform APIs. Field-Level Help — The Field-Level Help box allows you to define help text for the field that will appear in a popup when the user clicks the help icon next to the field. Note: On Edit pages, Platform adds an HTML DOM handler to automatically format the value of a Currency field (according to the selected format) when an input field loses focus. When you create a new Currency field for objects that support the multi-currency attribute, you can optionally create a counterpart Base Currency field that will transfer the foreign currency amount into the currency of your bookkeeping. Note: Due to database limitations, Currency and Decimal fields cannot hold values larger than 100,000,000,000.0</body>
