    <body>To use the S3 Compatible Storage service for file storage, you are required to have an S3 compatible subscription such as MinIO. You can retrieve the S3 ID and S3 Key values from the subscription details used. Note: The S3 Compatible Storage service supported by Platform has currently been verified against the MinIO cloud storage technology. Working with S3 Compatible Storage For further details on adding an S3 Compatible Storage and assigning it to the customer, refer File Storages and Creating a new customer record . Note: If you want to move your existing customer storage from cloud-cloud, local-cloud, or cloud-local, refer Working with customer records for more details. In the case of migration to Platform 5.4, for the ISV Partner and System Console applications, under the customer objects, it is recommended to delete the fields (S3 Bucket, S3 ID/Account Name, S3 Key/Account Key, S3 Compatible Storage, S3 Compatible URL, Cloud Storage) due to security reasons. The mentioned fields are no longer required by the system. Currently, Platform supports only slash (/) as the delimiter for the bucket name.</body>
