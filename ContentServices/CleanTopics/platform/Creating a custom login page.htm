    <body>A hosted or private cloud ISV account gives you the option to create and host a custom login page. This page can be hosted on another website to allow users to log into a Platform tenant. The login page should contain forms that store the user name and password, post them to Platform, and handle both successful and unsuccessful log in attempts. Please contact Platform support or your account manager if you want to see examples built by some existing hosted Platform or Platform Private Cloud customers. Custom HTML login pages must contain a form tag that includes the following: An action attribute pointing to https://app.infiniteblue.com/router/servlet/Router A loginName parameter that will store the login name specified by a user A password parameter that will store the password specified by a user An act hidden parameter with a value of login An rt hidden parameter points to the full URL of your custom login page (this parameter stands for "return to" and is stored as part of the user's session, so when they log out or their session expires, the user is automatically taken back to your custom login page rather than Platform.com) A CustomLogin hidden parameter with a value of true An errMsg parameter is optional. If this HTTP parameter is set in the login page, URL errors, such as an invalid user name, will be captured and displayed as error messages. If a login is unsuccessful, Platform will redirect the user back to your custom login page and display the error description set in the HTTP parameter errMsg. Infinite Blue strongly recommends that your custom login page captures and displays this error message when it is not empty. An o parameter is optional. If this HTTP parameter is set in the login page URL, it will be captured and stored in the o hidden parameter. For example, this parameter might contain the location of the first landing page. For Custom HTML login pages with Just-In-Time enabled, ensure the following parameters are included apart from the above mentioned: An ap hidden parameter with a value of AuthenticationProfile GUID. A custId parameter to store the CustomerId of the tenant on which the Just-In-Time user is created. A isSAMLJITEnabled parameter to store the value true.</body>
