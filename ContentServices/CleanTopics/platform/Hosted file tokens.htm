    <body>The following table summarizes the usage of merge field tokens corresponding to different types of hosted files: Token name Where used Replaced with Filename Anywhere, for example: {!#HOSTED_FILE.7034090} URL to the file hosted by Platform. When used in an email template, the hosted file is added to the email as an attachment instead of as a URL in the email body. Filename [image] Any template field or page-level HTML or Script component, for example: &lt;img src='{!#HOSTED_FILE.7034090}' border='0' align='absmiddle'/&gt; HTML &lt;img&gt; tag with URL to an image file. This works similarly to shared Image fields. Filename [text] Any template field or page-level HTML or Script component, for example: {!#HOSTED_FILE.13687907#text} Entire text of the hosted file. This approach has many possible usages, such as using custom JavaScript libraries in server-side formulas.</body>
