See Query API for examples and limitations. args Variable number of parameters passed to query (optional) Return value Query result as a single value Permissions required The current user must be logged into the master server. Unless this API is being used in delayed triggers or scheduled batch jobs, the current user must have either administrative permissions or View permission on the Customer object and the selected object type.
