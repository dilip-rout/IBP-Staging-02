    <body>In addition to basic field properties that vary based on the type of the field, Platform provides several advanced field properties that determine various field characteristics. Not all of these properties are available for all field types; for example, Image Upload and Formula fields cannot be indexed as part of the full text search engine. Index this field as part of the text search engine — This setting is available on text, numeric and date fields, as well as on file uploads. If enabled, this field will be indexed and added to the global search engine whenever a record is created and updated. Users will then be able to perform global and object-specific searches on this field (field-specific searches in filters, etc., do not require enabling this property). If an object definition does not have this option enabled for any field: On the object definition page, Text Index Enabled is deselected. The object is not listed in global search drop-down list. See Search for more information about global searches. The Search box is not displayed on selector pages. The Keywords box is not displayed on search pages Track all changes to this field in each record's Audit Trail for a complete historical log — Enabling this property automatically adds a record-level audit trail entry whenever the field is updated, showing the value of the field before and after the update, as well as the user that performed the update and the date and time the update occurred. This option is only available if the parent object has Audit Trail Enabled checked. See Auditing . for more information on auditing. Store uploaded files in an encrypted format. — This setting is only available for File Upload and Text fields. After applying this setting, you cannot undo it. Uploaded files are stored in encrypted format for added security and to meet compliance requirements. In views, encrypted fields cannot be used for sorting. Always require a value in this field in order to save a record — This is a global setting specifying whether this field is always required in form pages (such as New and Edit). If this property is enabled, it is not possible to make this field non-required at the page level using the page editor. Do not allow duplicate values in this field — This setting is only available for text-based fields (including auto-number). If set, it enforces uniqueness of this field's value across all records of that object type. This field allows inline editing from view pages by clicking on icon — When checked, users can edit this field on record view pages by clicking the pencil icon. Allow filtering by this field in List Views — When checked (the default), this field will appear in the drop-down list when filtering a view. When unchecked, this field will not appear in the drop-down list.</body>
