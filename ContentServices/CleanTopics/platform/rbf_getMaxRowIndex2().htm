    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose Returns the maximum value for the rowIndex in a grid. This may be different from the total number of rows in the grid. Note: A rowIndex is assigned to each grid row when it is first created or rendered. Deleting a row does not affect (decrement) indexes of other rows. Syntax rbf_getMaxRowIndex2(gridNo) Parameters gridNo The 0-based number of Grid Control on page Note: This API is not supported in portals. Example This function can be used to iterate through all grid rows: var n = rbf_getMaxRowIndex2(0); for (var rowIndex=0; rowIndex&lt;n; rowIndex++) { var x = rbf_getGridValue2(0, "amount", rowIndex); }</body>
