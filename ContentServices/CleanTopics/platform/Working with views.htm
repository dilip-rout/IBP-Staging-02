    <body>Views are result sets. They are key object components because they determine how a user finds records and navigates through them. This section discusses how to create and configure views, and how to define grouping, sorting, totaling, and filtering behaviors (including dynamic filtering, expressions, and exporting). To troubleshoot views on Platform Private Cloud, an administrator on the master tenant can enable logging of SQL queries and results. For more information, see Enabling logging for charts and views</body>
