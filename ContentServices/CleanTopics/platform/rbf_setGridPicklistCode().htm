    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose Sets integration code of picklist field in a grid control with the given integration name at the specified row number. Has no effect if a field or grid control does not exist on the current page. This function is similar to rbf_setPicklistCode() . Reviewers: Since this function doesn't have a 2 in its name, is it deprecated? If so, should we remove it? Syntax rbf_setGridPicklistCode(gridNo, fieldName, rowIndex, optCode) Parameters gridNo The 0-based number of the grid control on the page fieldName The integration name of the input field rowIndex The row number. Row numbers start with 0. optCode Value will be compared to the integration code of a particular picklist option Note: This API is not supported in portals.</body>
