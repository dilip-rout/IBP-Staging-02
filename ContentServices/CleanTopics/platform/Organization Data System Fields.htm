    <body>Tree Fields of this type (Location, Department and Function) are automatically created when you select the "Organization" attribute for an Object. These Fields keep track on location of your record relative to LDF trees. See Location, Department &amp; Function permissions . If you check "Use user's Function value as default for new records" for this Field type, LDF attribute from user will be copied by default to newly created record.</body>
