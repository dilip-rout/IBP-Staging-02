    <body>The functions described in this section can be run in client-side scripts. Note: The methods in this section apply to the new UI, not the classic UI. Most Platform tenants are using the new UI. However, tenants on older Private Cloud installations might still be using the classic UI. These methods are not supported in portals.</body>
