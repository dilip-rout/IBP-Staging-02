    <body>With the Reference Field type, Users can reference any object record (typically parent) from current record (typically child). When creating this field select group of object which can be referenced. At run time User can select referenced Object type from drop-down list, then select actual record the same way as in Lookup field (by type-ahead or from pop-up window). Note: Avoid including too many object definitions in the primary list for optimal performance.</body>
