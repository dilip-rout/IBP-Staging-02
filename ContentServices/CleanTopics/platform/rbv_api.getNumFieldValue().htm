    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This Object Script method returns the numeric value of a field from an existing object record. This method is similar to getFieldValue(), but ensures that the returned value is a number or 0 if the field has a NULL value. Formulas used in Object Script triggers can include other API methods and regular Platform template functionality, such as loops. Object Script methods have no effect if called outside of update triggers. Syntax rbv_api.getNumFieldValue(objName, Id, fieldName) Parameters Parameter Description objName Integration name of object Id ID of record fieldName Integration name of field Return value Value of requested field Permissions required View permission for the selected object type.</body>
