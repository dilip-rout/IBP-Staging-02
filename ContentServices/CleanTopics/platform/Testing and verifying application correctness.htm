    <body>Before publishing your application, you can generate an Application Tree to verify that your application does not contain any errors. Due to the mechanics of the publishing and installation process, little information other than the component's internal ID is available to report errors when they occur. For this reason, the Application Tree Component allows you to more easily pinpoint and fix problems before they occur by showing components with errors in red. Application errors typically occur when a certain component has been deleted, but other components still have a reference to it. For example, a trigger may have a reference to a deleted conversion map. The application should not be published until these issues are fixed. Error messages may contain numeric IDs of missing application elements. See Troubleshooting published applications for suggestions on fixing common errors.</body>
