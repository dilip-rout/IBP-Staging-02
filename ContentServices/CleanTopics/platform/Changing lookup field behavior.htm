Follow these steps to change lookup field properties: Navigate to the page containing the lookup field you want to modify. Click the tools icon to display the Page Options menu. Select Design This Page to open the page editor. The following example page has two lookup fields, each identified by a magnifying icon, Titles and Library Members. Open the Properties menu to the right of the lookup field name: From the Style picklist, select one of the following: Selector — Users will be able to select related records using a pop-up window. Picklist — The field will contain the helper text Please Select. When a user clicks the field, a picklist displays available related records. For 1-many or many-many relationships, the user can select multiple records. Hidden — The field will not show on this page. From the Use List View picklist, select the view to be used for the selector or picklist. By selecting a filtered view, you can restrict the records available to end users. Set the remaining properties as follows: Use Record in Scope for New Objects — Select to pre-populate the lookup field with the last record of the type the user was viewing or editing.
