    <body>In Platform Private Cloud, you can add support for new languages by translating the English language resource file lang_en.properties and saving the translation as a new lang_NN.properties file, where NN corresponds to the 2-letter ISO 639-1 language code. Language resource files are stored in the directory &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt;\pas\rollbase\res. Note: Language resource files are encoded as UTF-8 with BOM. When you edit a language resource file, be sure to retain this encoding. It is the only supported encoding for this type of file. Some text editors, such as Notepad++ , will display the encoding for the open file. Each translation is a property name and value in the language resource file. Many property names include one of the following namespaces: newui.eu — Indicates that the translation is only used on application pages (New UI only). newui.admin — Indicates that the translation is only used on setup pages and for items on application pages (New UI only) that are only visible to administrators You can translate only application page properties, only administrative properties, or all properties. For example, to translate only end-user visible text on application pages that use the New UI, you only have to provide translations for properties with the namespace newui.eu. This greatly reduces the amount of effort required for the translation; you only have to translate about 1000 properties instead of translating over 5000 properties were you to translate everything. The following excerpt from the file lang_fr.properties shows how properties with and without namespaces appear for the French translation: newui.eu.AND = AND
newui.eu.And_By = Et par
newui.admin.Animate_Chart = Animer le graphique
newui.admin.Annotation_Type = Type d'annotation
Anonymous = Anonyme
Anonymous_Access = Accès anonyme For example, to add support for the Vietnamese language: Navigate to the directory &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt;\pas\rollbase\res. Open the file file lang_en.properties and save it as lang_vi.properties file. Edit the properties to provide translations and save the file. Restart your server and open your Platform instance. Select Vietnamese from the languages available on the Administration Setup&gt;Account Settings screen. After you have added support for a language, you can translate applications into that language.
