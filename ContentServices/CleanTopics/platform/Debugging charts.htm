    <body>Because Platform generates the underlying functionality for charts, they can be difficult to troubleshoot. On Platform Private Cloud, an administrator of the master tenant logged into a customer tenant can enable logging of the underlying SQL queries. See Enabling logging for charts and views for details. You can use the log file to see if the expected queries are being executed. Since logging can delay rendering of the charts, it should only be enabled temporarily for debugging purposes.</body>
