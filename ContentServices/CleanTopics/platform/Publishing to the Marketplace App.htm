    <body>For Platform Private Cloud installations that have been upgraded from a prior version, by default the Marketplace will be enabled as the way to publish and distribute applications. However, master administrators can enable Marketplace and provide it to their customer tenants as an alternative. Infinite Blue recommends switching to Marketplace because it provides a better user experience. Publishing an application to the Marketplace application makes it freely available for installation in any tenant in the same Private Cloud instance. By default, a master administrator must approve published applications before they appear in the Marketplace web page. Private Cloud administrators can change this behavior as needed by modifying the Published Application object in the master. To summarize, all applications that are published or unpublished reside in theMarketplace application. Whereas, when a master approves all the published applications, the applications becomes available in the Marketplace web page. If you continue development of an application that has already been published, you can publish updates to that application. Each updated application will have a higher version string than the last and customers who installed previous versions will be able to upgrade to the latest version. Private Cloud Master system administrators can also push updates of an application to all tenants that have installed the applications. See Pushing application updates to other tenants . Publishing an application to the Marketplace is a two-step process: A tenant administrator publishes the application Tenant administrators use the Publish option on an application’s view page to publish their application. This submits the application for publishing approval to the administrators of the master tenant. A master administrator approves the submitted application for publication on the Marketplace: Infinite Blue approves applications for the Hosted Marketplace Platform Private Cloud applications are published to the Marketplace after an administrator of the master tenant approves them using the Marketplace application (see Approving a published application in the Marketplace ) From the application switcher: To navigate to the settings for the current application, click App Settings. To navigate to settings for a different application, hover the mouse pointer over the application and click the settings icon. Click Publish or Publish Updates.
