    <body>A Template Field type is a non-editable Field that is automatically populated from a template expression you define. When you define a template Field, you can use merge Fields and HTML markup from the current Object record and any related records. Tip: Template Fields (with a hidden display label) can be a good way to add client-side JavaScript to your Application and Portal Pages.</body>
