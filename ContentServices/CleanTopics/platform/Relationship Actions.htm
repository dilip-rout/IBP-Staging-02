    <body>The Relationships section of an object definition has an Action column that allows you to perform different actions on the relationship, depending on its type. As shown in the example below, all relationships have Edit, Delete, Convert and Cleanup links. This section covers available actions. Edit You can update the Relationship Properties, Cardinality, Orphan Records Control and Cloning Control under this action. Delete This action permanently deletes the Relationship between the objects. Convert This action converts a simple relationship between two objects into a complex relationship by creating an intermediate object. Validate Cardinality This action validates all the records of this relationship for selected cardinality. The time taken to load may depend on the number of records in this relationship. Validate Cardinality can also be done from the Edit relationship page. This action helps to validate the new cardinality before saving the selected relationship. You can also perform this action under the More Actions drop-down in the relationship view page. Cleanup This action cleans up relationship entries from: RB_RELATIONSHIP table that does not have a valid object definition. RB_RELATIONSHIP table that is invalid. For every relationship record in RB_RELATIONSHIP table, invalid entries are determined by checking the data tables RB_CUST_DATA, RB_USER_DATA, RB_OBJ_DATA, and RB_DELETED_OBJS. This operation is done in batches as RB_RELATIONSHIP table may contain lots of relationship records. You can also perform this action under the More Actions drop-down in the relationship view page. Permissions You can assign permissions to the users or subscriber related objects from the Permissions link in the Relationships section or by editing object-related permissions.</body>
