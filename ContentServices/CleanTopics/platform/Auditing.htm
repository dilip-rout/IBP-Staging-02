    <body>Platform automatically tracks some activities, and you can enable additional logging as described below. Audit trail entries are created automatically for activities such as creating, merging, and converting records. Platform also creates audit trail entries when an administrative user makes changes to an object definition or an application. The Audit Trail component at the bottom of the object definition or application definition contains these entries. The following example shows an application Audit Trail section. Click Show All to view audit trail entries in a pop-up window, from which you can export a full history of changes. By default, the System Info section of a record view page contains audit trail entries as shown in the following screen. You can move the component or remove it by editing the page. The Audit Trail list view component shows the 20 most recent entries. Use Show All from the Action menu to see up to 100 entries in a pop-up window. You can also export all entries to XLS or CSV format from this window. Audit trail records cannot be modified or deleted manually. Platform deletes the audit trail only when an associated tenant is deleted. You can enable finer-grained auditing in the following ways: To track changes made to records, enable Audit Trail property on an object definition. You can selectively enable tracking of operations like view, edit, and delete. When enabled, the Audit Trail property allows Platform to track changes to record fields made by API calls, triggers, and end users. You can enable the Audit Trail attribute during object creation, or for existing objects, by editing the object definition . When an email related to a record is sent. In this case, the View control displays a copy of the email message that was sent. This audit trail entry is created when the email message is actually sent, typically with a short delay. To track changes for a particular field, in the object definition, edit the field. A field-level audit can be enabled only when the audit is enabled at the object level. To generate custom, template-based audit trail entries, create a workflow trigger of type Create Activity Trail Record.</body>
