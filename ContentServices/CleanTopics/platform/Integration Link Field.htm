    <body>An Integration Link Field type is a custom link, typically used to pass Platform data to external systems, your intranet, or other web-based applications by using merge Fields to insert the value of one or more Fields as parameters in the URL. Integration link Fields display as links and they open in a new browser window when clicked. Integration link Fields work similar to URL Fields, but they allow the use of merge Fields to dynamically construct a URL based on data in the current Object record, versus URL Fields which simply store a hard-coded URL. Check "Use field's label as link and hide URL", otherwise actual URL will be shown in link.</body>
