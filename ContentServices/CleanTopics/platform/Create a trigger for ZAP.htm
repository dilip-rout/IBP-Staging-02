On hovering over the + sign button in the left-hand navigation, click MAKE A ZAP to create a new Zap in the Zapier editor. You will be redirected to a When this happens section. In the Choose App &amp; Event section search bar, find and select Infinite Blue Platformapp. Select REST Hook as the Choose Trigger Event from the drop-down below and click Continue.

You can select Webhooks by Zapier in the Choose App &amp; Event section while creating a new ZAP. Once done, select Catch Hook from Trigger Event dropdown. Click Continue and a Custom Webhook URL is generated. While using the REST Hook trigger event method, Infinite Blue Platform sends a request to Zapier when a record is either created or updated. Sign in to Infinite Blue Platform account under the Choose App &amp;&#160;Event section. If you are already signed, select the existing account and click Continue. Enter the Email &amp; Sample Infinite Blue JSON Output fields in the Customize Record section, and click Continue. A REST&#160;Hook dynamic URL is generated and will only be sent to the prescribed email once the ZAP is created and turned ON. Sample REST&#160;Hook dynamic URL: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/7082424/orwpsb6/ Copy the REST&#160;Hook dynamic URL received on the email. You can send a request to this REST&#160;Hook dynamic URL using Infinite Blue Platform triggers. From the Infinite Blue Platform UI, create an object script trigger for the desired object with after create timing. (See Triggers for more information on creating triggers) Use rbv_api.sendJSONRequest Server API to send the data to Zapier. You can also use HTTP POST or REST trigger to send the data. Copy Sample object script trigger code: url = "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/7082424/or6p7tg/"; data = '{"First_Name": "{!First_Name}", "name": "{!name#text}" }'; var zapierResponse = rbv_api.sendJSONRequest(url, data, "POST", "UTF-8", null, null, null,null); Create or update a record and ensure that the above object script trigger is executed. Now from the Zapier UI, click Continue. Click Test Trigger. A sample output record is found in the Find Data section. Click Continue to proceed to the Do this section. You have now created an Infinite BluePlatform Trigger in Zapier. Next, see Creating an action in ZAP .</body>
