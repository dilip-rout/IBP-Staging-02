    <body>The Hosted Platform infrastructure is hosted in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other security technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. The Platform Private Cloud infrastructure is hosted in your own server environment that uses your own firewalls and security technology to protect it. When you access the Platform service via HTTPS, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure and available only to registered users in your account. As long as your authentication information (username and password) are kept safe, your data remains inaccessible to unauthorized viewing and use. See User authentication for details about user authentication. Platform provides a sophisticated set of access control mechanisms that allow you to grant users permission to access applications and their components. See Access control for details. Platform Private Cloud provides additional access control mechanisms. See Private Cloud security and access control for details. Topics in this chapter describe security features that are available in both Hosted Platform and Platform Private Cloud. See Private Cloud security and access control for security features unique to Platform Private Cloud.</body>
