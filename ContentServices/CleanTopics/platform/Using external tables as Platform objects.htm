    <body>In Platform Private Cloud, external objects allow you to integrate tables managed by other applications into a Platform application. Each external object maps to an external table. External objects have almost all of the same features as native Platform objects, but the data remains stored in the external table rather than in Platform. For other ways to integrate data using external objects, see Using DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline to access external data or Creating Platform objects from OpenEdge Object Services . The following topics describe how to use external tables in Platform Private Cloud.</body>
