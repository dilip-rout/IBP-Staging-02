    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This Object Script method sets the value of a field for an existing object record. For picklists and status fields, use integration names, since they will be valid after publishing and installing your application, unlike numeric ids. When called outside of a transaction scope, for instance, in a JavaScript report, the setFieldValue() method changes the field value temporarily. The setFieldValue() method does not invoke triggers before or after the update occurs. The reason is that this method can often be used repeatedly to update several fields and invoking triggers on each update may result in undesired behavior. Formulas used in Object Script triggers can include other API methods and regular Platform template functionality, such as loops. Object Script methods have no effect if called outside of update triggers. Syntax rbv_api.setFieldValue(objName, Id, fieldname, newValue) Parameters objName Integration name of object Id ID of record fieldName Integration name of field to set value in newValue Value to be set Return value None Permissions required View permission for the selected object type. Example The following code sets a picklist (single-selection) or radio-buttons value: rbv_api.setFieldValue("order", {!id}, "size", "S"); The following sets a picklist (multi-selection) or group of checkboxes value: rbv_api.setFieldValue("order", {!id}, "size", Array("S", "M")); An alternative use is with a comma-separated string of integration codes or numeric ids: rbv_api.setFieldValue("order", {!id}, "size", "S,M"));</body>
