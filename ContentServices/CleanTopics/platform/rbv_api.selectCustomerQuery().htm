    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose Similar to selectQuery2() , but is called from the master server and runs on the customer tenant with the specified ID. Do not use this API for views. This method throws an error if the target customer tenant does not have the queried object installed. This method might require cache loading and might be slow. Note: When used in a trigger on a customer object with "After Create" timing, this API should be made to run as a delayed trigger. Syntax rbv_api.selectCustomerQuery (custId, query, rowFrom, maxRows, arg1, arg2…) Parameters custId ID of the customer record to query query SQL SELECT query. See Query API for examples and limitations. rowFrom Number of row to start output (0 based) maxRows Maximum number of rows to retrieve (1-20,000 range) args Variable number of parameters passed to query (optional) Return value Query results as a 2-D array Permissions required The current user must be logged into the master server. Unless this API is being used in delayed triggers or scheduled batch jobs, the current user must have either administrative permissions or View permission on the Customer object and the selected object type. See Managing customer tenants for more information about customer tenants and the master server.</body>
