    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This method modifies record values of a Platform object without changing UI presentation. If an error occurs during the operation, an error notification procedure will be invoked (see rbf_setErrorsCallback ). For all fields including the file and image upload that allow values in multiple languages, you can specify those values using the fieldMap parameter. When updating field values, it only mandatory to update a field value in the tenant's base language when that field does not already have a value in the base language. The current user must have Edit permission on the selected object type to run this API. Syntax rbf_updateRecordMultiPart(objName, id, fieldMap, useIds, callback, useLegacyDateFormat) Parameters objName The integration name of the selected Object definition id ID of the selected Object record fieldMap A JSON object of the form: {"fieldIntegrationName1":value1, "fieldIntegrationName2":value2}. When setting field values for multilingual fields, each value can be a JSON object, for example: {"fileupload":"","imageupload":"","fieldIntegrationName1":{"en":"EnglishValue1","ar":"ةشغشىن","fr":"FrenchValue1"}, "fieldIntegrationName2":{"en":"EnglishValue2","ar":"ةشغشىن","fr":"FrenchValue2"}} Note: This API does not accept the file path due to security reasons. To upload the files and images, select the files from the UI and execute the API. useIds If true, the API will accept numeric IDs; if false (default) the API will return integration codes for status fields and picklists callback A function to be executed when the operation is successful. It does not receive any parameters. This is an optional parameter. useLegacyDateFormat This optional parameter only applies to JSON output and, specifically, to Date and Date/Time fields. If true , or if not specified, a date value is returned as a Date object. If false , a date value is returned as a String. Note: This API is supported in portals as well. Example The following example returns the query to update a multi part record: function my_callback(count) {
console.log("Count is: " + count);
} rbf_updateRecordMultiPart("newobj1",{!id},{"fileupload":"","imageupload":"", "fileText":{"en":"EnglishValureq1","fr":"FrenchrValueq1"}},false, my_callback, false);</body>
