    <body>In Platform, you can publish and distribute applications in the following ways: To give others who have an account in your tenant access to an application, assign specific users or user roles the appropriate permissions. See User authentication and Role-based access control . To distribute to the Platform community for sale or free, publish an application to the Platform Marketplace. See Using the Infinite Blue Platform Marketplace and Publishing to the Marketplace App . To provide the application to users in other tenants, perhaps used by other groups in your organization, generate an XML version of the application. Any Platform user with a role of Administrator can install the application in their tenant. See Distributing applications in XML format and Generating application XML .</body>
