    <body>This topic covers general steps to create a trigger. For specific examples, see Example: Set field based on a workflow status change , or watch Web App Trigger Examples to see how triggers can update fields in related records and create new records. Navigate to the object definition. For example: From an application page, select Object Definition from the Page Options menu: In the ribbon of object components, click Triggers: Click New Trigger. The New Trigger screen opens. Select the trigger type and click Next. The options available on the next screen depend on the type of trigger you select. Finalize the definition of your trigger using the controls on this screen: Deployment Status — If checked, the trigger will run. If unchecked, the trigger will not run. Trigger Timing — Causes the trigger to fire during events in a record lifecycle. See Trigger timing options for details. General Properties — Enter a Name and an Integration Name. The Integration Name should be unique across the object definition. If you selected Before Update or After Update timing, choose the field(s) for which an update should fire the trigger. Trigger Properties — Read the Tip to understand what type of formula the trigger expects. Use the Template Helper and formula editor to create and validate the expression. See Best practices for trigger formulas for more information. Trigger Delay Time — Optionally, set a delay time. See Delayed and recursive triggers for details. Recursion — Optionally, set times for the trigger to repeat. See Delayed and recursive triggers for details. Click Save. Platform creates the trigger and it appears in the Triggers table in the object definition. You can control the order in which triggers fire by reordering them in this table.</body>
