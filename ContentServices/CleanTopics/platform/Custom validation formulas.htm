    <body>In addition to validation rules based on the security level, you can define a custom validation formula (rule) to ensure that users' passwords satisfy your security policy. You must use password authentication to define a custom validation formula. To define a custom validation formula: Navigate to the Setup home page: From an application page, do one of the following: Select Setup Home from the Platform menu . Select Setup Home from the application switcher . In the Administration Setup section, click Authentication. On the Authentication page, enter the body of a JavaScript function with a single input parameter, password. The function should return an error message for an invalid password or NULL for a valid password. The following example ensures that the user's password includes at least one special character: '@' or '#': if (password.indexOf('@')&lt;0 &amp;&amp; password.indexOf('#')&lt;0) return "Password must include a special character."; After specifying your custom validation formula, you can click Debug Formula to find and fix any errors or inconsistencies in the formula.</body>
