    <body>A workflow action represents a manual action such as a click or a selection that changes a record's status, sends an email, invokes a trigger, etc. Platform supports several types of actions as described in the following sections. When you configure a workflow status, you specify which workflow actions are available for records with that status. See Workflow status for details. Access to workflow actions can be limited only to certain roles or users. For more information about access control, see Access control . Workflow actions on application pages By default, workflow actions appear in the actions menu on a record view page: You can configure a workflow action to appear as a button instead of in the actions menu: The read-only field Workflow Actions renders links to available actions. This field can be added to record view pages and as a column in list views: You can reorder workflow actions to set the order in which they appear in any list. To reorder workflow actions, navigate to the Workflow Actions area on an object definition page and click Reorder. Use the arrows to reorder the actions. Group workflow actions If you enable group actions for a particular workflow action, that action becomes available for a group of selected records in list views by selecting the action from the group actions menu: If a group workflow action has formula-based condition, selected records will be filtered using that condition.</body>
