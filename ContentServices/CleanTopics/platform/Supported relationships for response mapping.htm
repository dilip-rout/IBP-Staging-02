    <body>The following table describes where response mapping is supported based on the existence and types of relationships between Corticon entities and between Platform objects. In the table, Base entity/Base object is the top-level object/entity in the tree structure and Associated entity/Related object is an entity/object with which the base entity or object has a relationship. Messages are Corticon messages posted by the decision service to relay information about the result of the service execution. Response mapping can update and create Platform records. The Operation column of the table shows the operation(s) for each use case. Platform object Corticon entities Platform relationship Corticon relationship Operation Supported Base object Base entity N/A N/A Update Yes Base object Associated entity N/A 1:1 Update Yes Base object Associated entity N/A 1:M (Update from first matching response) Update Yes Related object Associated entity 1:1 or 1:M or M:M N/A N/A No Related object Associated entity 1:1 1:1 Create/Update/UpdateElseCreate Yes Related object Associated entity 1:M or M:M 1:M or 1:1 Create/Update/UpdateElseCreate Yes Related object Associated entity 1:1 1:M (Returns the first matching response) Create/Update/UpdateElseCreate Yes Base object Messages N/A 1:M (Returns the first matching message) Update Yes Related object Messages 1:1 1:M (Returns the first matching message) Create Yes Related object Messages 1:M or M:M 1:M Create Yes For mappings that involve many entities or messages on the Corticon side but only one record on the Platform side, the response contains only the first matching response or message. For example, the following response mapping maps a field from messages resulting from the decision service execution to a field in the Platform Message object. Because the relationship from Applicant to Message is one-to-many in both Corticon and Platform, running the decision service can create multiple Message records as described in the last row of the table.</body>
