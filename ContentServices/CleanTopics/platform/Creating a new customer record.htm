    <body>A Customer record defines the applications, security level, storage information and usage for an organization or group that will be using a customer tenant. Follow these steps to create a new Customer record. Log in to the Private Cloud master tenant as an administrator. From the application switcher, select System Console. Select the Customers tab. In the Customers List section, click New Customer. Enter the following information: Database — select the database to hold this customer's data. Plan — select a pricing plan to determine default limits on the number of records, fields and other resources allowed for this customer. See System Console &gt; System &gt; Control Panel &gt; Configuration &gt; Service Levels for information on how to customize these plans. Security Level — select the security level for the customer tenant. The customer can later change this from their Account Settings page. Applications — select the applications to be installed into the new customer tenant. If this field does not appear on the New Customer page, click Design This Page and drag Applications Lookup onto the page from the Available Components list. The Platform application will be included by default. It is required, do not remove it. For more information, see Installing applications in new tenants automatically . Email — specify the email address for the first administrative user for this customer tenant. If you do not want the first user to have the Administrator role, you can change that user's role and create a customer tenant with no administrators. See Creating a tenant with no administrative users for details. Storage Server — The default storage server is pre-defined, select a new storage server to the customer, if desired. Storage Location — The default storage location is pre-defined, select a new storage location corresponding to selected Storage server or any of the Amazon S3, S3 Compatible Storage, or Microsoft Azure file storages for the customer, if desired. Note: Post migration to Platform 5.4, check if the Customer is using the mentioned fields: S3 Bucket, S3 ID/Account Name, S3 Key/Account Key, S3 Compatible URL, and Cloud Storage. It is recommended to delete them from the customer objects under ISV Partner and System Console applications due to security reasons. The mentioned fields are no longer required by the system. Search Server — if more than one search server is installed, select the search server assigned to this customer. Click Save to create the record, or click Save and New to save the record and create another Customer record. After several seconds or minutes (depending on the speed of your server) the system will finish the tenant creation process by installing all selected applications. Until tenant creation is completed, the Login button on the Customer view page is disabled. The page will be refreshed automatically when process is completed and the button will be enabled. After this is finished, Platform sends a welcome email to the first administrative user, who will then be able to log in to the new tenant. When an administrator of the master tenant logs in to a customer tenant, they have super-admin privileges.</body>
