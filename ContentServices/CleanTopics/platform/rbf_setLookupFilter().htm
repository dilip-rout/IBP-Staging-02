    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function sets a filter on the selection of related records for a lookup field. This method only applies to Selector type lookup fields and cannot be used for dependent lookups. This method can be used for dynamic filtering of available lookup choices. Syntax rbf_setLookupFilter(fieldname, filterName, filterValue); Parameters fieldName Integration name of the lookup field filterName Name of the related object field used for filtering filterValue Value of fields to display Note: This API is supported in portals as well. Return Value Example The call in the following example ensures that the selector window opening on the R12345 lookup field only displays records where the value of the club_menber field equals true. rbf_setLookupFilter('R12345', 'club_menber', 'true');</body>
