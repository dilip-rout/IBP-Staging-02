    <body>Note: To start Tomcat on Windows, you need to be logged in as an administrator using an account that has read and write permissions for the Platform installation directory. Follow these steps to start the Private Cloud components: If necessary, start the database. If you used the Platform installer and had it install OpenEdge, the database should be running. You can verify by doing the following: Open a command prompt (on Windows systems, run it as an administrator). Change directories to the oe_rollbase_db folder of your installation. If you used the default location, this location is Progress\WRK\oe_rollbase_db. If the database is running, you will see a rbdb.lk file. If not, run the startdb script. Start the Web server in one of the following ways: If you used the Platform installer and installed PAS, open a command prompt as an administrator, navigate to the Pas_Instance\bin folder, and run tcman start. If you installed Tomcat yourself, open a command prompt as an administrator and run the Tomcat startup.bat script located in the bin folder of the Tomcat installation. Enter the URL for your Web server in a browser. If you are using PAS, use http://localhost:8830/router/login/loginPrivate.jsp or https://localhost:8831/router/login/loginPrivate.jsp , which redirect you to the Platform login page. If you installed Tomcat using the default port, use http://localhost:8080 . The Platform login page (or Tomcat home page if you are not using PAS) should open. If it does not, check to make sure that JRE_HOME is set properly and that you have administrative privileges. Log in using the temporary password from the Platform welcome email. When Platform starts, this email is sent to the administrative email user specified in the Shared Properties . Bookmark the URL for future use. Change the temporary password. From the Applications drop-down menu, select System Console and verify that all components are running. Verify that all applications described in Private Cloud Applications are successfully installed. If you need to stop the OpenEdge database, run the stopdb.bat script in the work directory you specified during installation. If you need to stop Tomcat, run the shutdown.bat script for standalone instances or stop the service.</body>
