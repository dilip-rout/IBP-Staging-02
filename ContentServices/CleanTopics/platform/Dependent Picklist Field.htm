    <body>The Dependent Picklist Field type is a special type of single-select picklist that displays different available values depending on the current selection in another (main) picklist. This main picklist must be selected before creating a dependent picklist. For each value of the main picklist, you can enter a comma-separated list of available values as shown below. A typical example of a dependent picklist is a list of States or Provinces that depends on the selection of a Country picklist. Once the selection in the Country picklist changes, Platform will automatically update the available list of states. For more information on configuring case-sensitivity of picklist field values, see Configuring picklist case-sensitivity . Limitation: Each value in a dependent picklist may belong to only one value from the main picklist. If you need to re-use values in dependent picklists because one or more values needs to be associated with more than one value from the main picklist, you should instead create new Object definitions and use a lookup Field dependency. See the Relationships section below for more information regarding configuring relationship Lookup Fields to use Main and Link lookups to dynamically filter available selection choices.</body>
