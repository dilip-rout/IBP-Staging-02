    <body>Purpose This Object Script method schedules a background job to create relationship with multiple records. Optionally, it uses a valid input script snippet - runExpression, and evaluates it once the scheduled job is executed. Formulas used in the runExpression snippet and Object Script triggers can include other API methods and regular Platform template functionality, such as loops. Object Script methods are not affected if called outside the update triggers. Syntax rbv_api.attachAsync (relName, objName1, objId1, objName2, objIds2, runExpression) relName Integration name of the relationship. objName1 Integration name of the first object. objId1 ID of the first object record. objName2 Integration name of the second object. objIds2 Array of numeric IDs of the second object record. runExpression (Optional) A string containing formula that can include other API methods. Permissions required Edit permission for the selected object types. Example In the input, ensure the array ids constitutes only the number type valid record IDs. Copy var selResult = rbv_api.selectQuery2("SELECT ID, PRICE FROM LineItem where PRICE&gt;0", 0, 10, null, null); var ids = []; for(var i=0; i&lt;selResult.length; i++) { ids[i] = Number(selResult[i][0]); } var codeSnippet = 'rbv_api.runTrigger("Invoice", {!id}, "GenerateInvoice", false, false)'; rbv_api.attachAsync("R36189", "Invoice", {!id}, "LineItem", ids, codeSnippet);</body>
