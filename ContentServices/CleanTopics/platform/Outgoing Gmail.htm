    <body>To use your Gmail account from Platform, you must first provide your Gmail credentials and enable IMAP on your Gmail account. See Enabling Google integration for details. By default, Platform uses its own email server when sending email messages from a Platform user. You can change this behavior on the Third Party Settings page to specify that Platform should use Gmail (rather than Platform email server) to send emails for this user. If you specify that Platform should use Gmail for outgoing emails, Platform will use Gmail to send emails on your behalf. This means that you will now see all Platform-generated emails in your Gmail account's Sent Mail folder. In addition, when a recipient replies, Gmail will group reply messages with your original message for convenience. When you send an email using Gmail integration, Platform will display a reminder about it and give you a chance to test your Gmail connections to ensure that your stored credentials are up-to-date with your Google account.</body>
