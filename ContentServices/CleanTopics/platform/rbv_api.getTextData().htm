    <body>Purpose This Object Script method returns uploaded file as a plain-text string. Use only with plain-text uploaded files, such as HTML or CSV. This method only works with native Platform objects. Note: This API method works with Non-ASCII characters as well. However, if your text file contains characters other than plain ASCII, you must ensure you save the text file as UTF-8 before uploading it. Formulas used in Object Script triggers can include other API methods and regular Platform template functionality, such as loops. Object Script methods have no effect if called outside of update triggers.
