    <body>When you create a new view, the record name field is automatically added to Selected Columns. If you do not include the record name field in the view, Platform displays a warning message asking if you are sure you do not want to include it. The record name field provides a link to drill down to the record's detail page, which is why it is typically not a good idea to exclude this field from your views. You can include templates and formula fields in a view. However, this might result into decreased performance due to a high volume of server-side calculations. You can define which fields you want appear as columns in your view. For example, you might want to hide this column in views exposed in external portals. See Field actions for more information. Move the columns you want in the view to the Selected Columns list. Use the arrows on the right to change their position in the view: Use the checkbox labeled Show "Actions" column in this view to specify whether or not you want users who can access this view to see the standard Actions column that contains edit and delete controls:</body>
