    <body>Topics in this section describe APIs that can be used to modify the browser-side experience. Access control permissions apply to client-side AJAX APIs. The current user requires access permission to execute many AJAX APIs. See each API to see which permissions are required. If the current user does not have appropriate permissions to access the API, the API call fails. For more information about security and access permissions, see Security and access control .</body>
