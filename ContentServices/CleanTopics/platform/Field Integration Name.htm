    <body>Each field has a unique Integration Name that is used by formulas, templates, and Platform APIs. This name must be unique across all fields in an object definition. When you create a new field, Platform automatically assigns an Integration Name derived from the display label; you can change it at any time. Integration names for system fields and automatically created fields cannot be changed. Infinite Blue recommends using a naming convention for fields. Changing the Integration Name will affect all existing templates, formulas and integrations that use that field. A field Integration Name must conform to the following rules: Cannot be more than 20 characters long. Must start with a letter. Cannot include space ‘ ‘ or pound ‘#' characters. Must be unique (case-insensitive) across other field integration names in the same object. Must not be one of the reserved system integration names: startdate, duedate, act, id, id2, ids, srcid, destid, objdefid, cloneid, returned, view, actionid, relid, relatedid, gridid, gridrows, griddeleted, country, state, priority, commtype, category, isactive, Fieldname, tag</body>
