    <body>This section outlines the new feature enhancements appended and advances made in Platform 5.7.0.0. 1. REST API 2.0 - Phase 2 Beta : We continue to invest and improve in API 2.0 and Release 5.7.0.0 includes more functionality. In our previous release REST V2.0 had most of the Data APIs and this release has enriched the collection by adding “Metadata APIs” and “Admin APIs”. a. Metadata APIs These APIs enables our app developers to consume and get the information of application structure definition which includes definition of Application, Objects, Fields, Views, Triggers and others. This enables them to better design their business logic and more control on the information available through API. b. Admin APIs Admin APIs are enabling admins to access the information using APIs. These information are such as Roles, Permissions, Authentication and others 2. Miscellaneous: The two other changes in this release are: a. Integration Names In this release we have added Integration Names as non-mandatory fields to most of the application elements, including: Application, Triggers, BatchJobs, Portals, Roles, Views and others. These Integration Names will be required when developers want to consume the elements using REST API 2.0, which identifies these elements uniquely by Integration Name. This gives the capability of REST API code to be portable across systems &amp; environments. b. Oracle DB support discontinued Our customers have minimal or no utilization of the Oracle DB so we are discontinuing our support. We have added Postgres DB support in the Infinite Blue Platform, which is currently available as Beta feature.</body>
