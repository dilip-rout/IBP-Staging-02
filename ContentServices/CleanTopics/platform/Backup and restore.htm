    <body>As hosted Platform is a fully managed Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, Platform handles data backup and other disaster recovery solutions. However, you can protect yourself from inadvertent data losses, such as unintentionally deleted records, objects, or applications, by scheduling system backups. Only administrators can perform backups. Only one backup file per tenant can be created per 24-hour period for performance reasons. Platform allows customer tenants to take ten backups per month and stores up to seven copies of the most recent backups. Hosted Platform users can contact Infinite Blue Support to change the number of backups per month limit for a customer tenant. The process of creating a backup file runs asynchronously and uses a queue. You receive an email when the backup is completed and ready to be downloaded. A full backup is in a compressed (ZIP) file that contains: Relational data, all system tables with data as CSV files (one CSV per object definition). Binary data, all hosted files, file templates, and images. Hosted Platform enforces a 1 GB limit for your backup data. Note that your backup file might not include the uploaded file templates, images, and hosted files if your storage exceeds the specified limit. For example, if you have 500 MB of relational data and 800 MB of hosted files, then Platform creates a backup file with only 500 MB of relational data. It does not back up the hosted files. To back up more than 1 GB of data (relational data and hosted files), you can configure and manage data backup using your own Amazon S3 cloud storage account or you can contact Platform customer support to resize your 1 GB data backup limit. Platform Private Cloud sets the backup data limit to 20 MB per customer tenant. As an administrator of the Platform master tenant, you can reset the 20 MB limit using the StorageUsageLimitForBkp property value in the Shared Properties file. The StorageUsageLimitForBkp property value specifies the backup data limit for all the customer tenants. If you want to specify a different backup data limit for a particular customer tenant, you must Edit the customer record and update the Max Backup File Storage (MB) field with the different backup data limit. This backup data limit specified in the customer record overrides the backup limit set in the Shared Properties. Platform Private Cloud sets the maximum backups per month limit to 10 per customer tenant. As an administrator of the Platform master tenant, you can reset this limit using the MaxBackupsPerMonth property value in the Shared Properties. The MaxBackupsPerMonth property value specifies the maximum backups per month limit for all the customer tenants. If you want to specify a different limit for a particular customer tenant, you must Edit the customer record and update the Max Backups Per Month field with the different limit. The limit specified in the customer record page overrides the maximum backups per month limit set in the Shared Properties. For more information about Shared Properties and working with customer records, see Shared Properties and Working with customer records . Backup Follow these steps to create and download a backup file for your tenant: Navigate to the Setup Home page from the application switcher. In the Administration Setup area, click Backup. To create a backup file, click Create New System Backup. After the backup is complete, click Download to download the backup file to your local machine. On Platform Private Cloud, an administrator on the master tenant can back up a customer tenant. See Working with customer records for more information. Additionally, you can click View Backup Log to view all the data backup activities performed. Restore If you are using hosted Platform, or if you are using Platform Private Cloud and you want to restore the master tenant, you must contact Platform customer support to restore your data from a particular backup file. If you are using Platform Private Cloud, an administrators on the master tenant can restore data to a customer tenant from a backup file. Follow these steps to restore a customer tenant: Acquire a backup file from your customer. Open the System Console application. Select the Customers tab. From the Customer List table, click the name of the customer tenant to restore. From the More actions menu, select System Backup &amp; Restore: Click Upload System Backup. Click Browse to select the required backup file. Click Submit to restore data from the backup file. When the restore is complete, you will receive an email from Platform. Note: The restore operation erases any changes made since the backup file was created. On completion of the restore process, make sure to synchronize the subscribers. If you are an ISV and/or are using Platform Private Cloud, and you want to use third-party cloud services for storage, see Using a third-party cloud service for storage . Note: When the backup or restore action is in progress, you will not be able to create another backup.</body>
