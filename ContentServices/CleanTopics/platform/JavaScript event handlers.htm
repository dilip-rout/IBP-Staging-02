    <body>Field-level events allow you to define custom JavaScript code that executes when a DOM event is invoked. You can attach JavaScript to any of the following DOM events for a field: onchange, onclick, onfocus, onblur, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover and onmouseout. By calling JavaScript functions defined in your pages or in hosted JavaScript code libraries, you can use field-level events to create a variety of dynamic page behavior. In addition, you can use the Platform AJAX API to add a further level of dynamism to your pages. For more information about client-side scripting in Platform, see Programmatic client-side customization .</body>
