If you select the Enable retry checkbox, you must input values into the following mandatory fields. Status Codes — Set status code on which you want the HTTP retries to happen. It can be a comma separated values of status codes as well as a range of status codes. For example, 302-400,500. Number of Retries — Set the number of retries allowed for the trigger. The maximum number of retries must not exceed 3. Retry Interval — Set the interval (ms) between two subsequent retries. The maximum retry timeout value (Retry Interval * Number of retries) can be configured using MaxHttpRetryTimeoutInMins shared.property. Default value of MaxHttpRetryTimeoutInMins is 1 min. Template for URL used to reach SMS Gateway. This template typically should include: Login credentials for your SMS account Address of SMS sender Phone number of SMS recipient Text of SMS message Request type: HTTP GET or HTTP POST Timeout (in ms) for HTTP request The following example shows a URL template which reaches to Clickatell SMS Gateway (https://www.clickatell.com/): http://api.clickatell.com/http/sendmsg?user={!#SETTINGS.sms_user}&amp;password={!#SETTINGS.sms_password}&amp;
api_id={!#SETTINGS.sms_api_id}&amp;MO=1&amp;from={!#SETTINGS.sms_from}&amp;to={!cell_phone#value}&amp;
text=Your+verification+code+{!ver_code} Please note: SMS credentials (user name, password, API ID, sender's phone number) are stored in Settings object.
