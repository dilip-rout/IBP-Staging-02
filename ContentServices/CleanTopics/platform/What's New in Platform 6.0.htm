    <body>This section outlines a summary of recent new significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes bundled with the Infinite BluePlatform version 6.0. If you are currently on version 5.0 or later, you can dependably upgrade to version 6.0 without any reluctance. Here are the major updates: 1. New Licensing Mechanism Introducing a new licensing mechanism for Infinite BluePlatform 6.0. This will enable Infinite Blue customers to place new license request online. This new license mechanism also enables them to manage their licenses on portal. This mechanisms uplifts from a conventional file-based static license issuance system to a license service-based model. A self-service license management portal is also introduced to cater the licensing requirements of all customers. Where the customer can: Place request for a new license Track license requests &amp; manage existing licenses. Receive notification of License/License-request status via Email Self-Service License parameters Host-Name Contact Email System Name For detailed information on this, see License Management Portal . 2.	Multi-Factor Authentication Infinite Blue Platform has enhanced security by, introducing Multi-Factor Authentication (also coined as Two-Factor authentication or 2FA) which offers an extra security layer by protecting the Platform user from any unknown person breaching-in to gain access of the instance. Multi-Factor authentication is an admin controlled feature, where the administrator can choose for which users MFA can be enabled. Multi-Factor authentication is a TOTP based service where the users can utilize a third-party authenticator mobile application (Google Authenticator/Twilio Authy/Others) to get registered and obtain TOTP for authentication. For detailed information, see Multi-Factor Authentication . 3.	REACT UI Beta Preceding to the 6.0 release, Platform instances by default utilized Kendo UI engine which is based on JQuery framework to render the Application UI. At parity with the contemporary industry standards, Platform has incorporated a REACT UI engine based on Ant Design library to render the Application UI. Using an easy-to-use toggle button, Platform users can switch from the Classic (Kendo UI) to the latest React UI any time without impacting any app or meta data. Additionally, the Ant Design library is bundled with widgets and can accommodate widgets from multiple other libraries. For detailed information, see React UI and UI Configurator . 4.	Versioning with GIT Integration (SDLC) To build an application deployment pipeline, an integration with external source control tool like GIT would add value for an effective software development lifecycle. Likewise, Platform v6.0 is bundled to integrate with GIT to enable Platform Users to grow and perform collaboratively in a large development team. With Platform’s low-code application development feasibility, application development and distribution are highly possible for any multi-tenant application management, along with GIT’s versioning management. For detailed information, see Git Integration in Control Panel and Configuring Administrative Preferences . 5.	Enhanced REST APIs In a nutshell, the enhanced REST APIs is more intuitive, resourceful and contextualized. Now REST API parameters are better organized, and the documentation is a beginner developer friendly, with every parameter detailed, endpoint described, and response examples laid out based on a use-cases. The two-pane style of API documentation details every endpoint in the left along with relevant examples in the right. For detailed information, see REST 2.0 API documentation. 6.	Background Job Processing Utilizing the method of asynchronous processing of record mass updates, Infinite Blue Platformv6.0 as an enhancement can now adequately direct any time constraint and resource centric record export jobs to the background which run synchronously. Therefore, avoids restrictions on the UI for jobs incurring a significantly large number of records. See Exporting from views and reports for more information. 7. Miscellaneous Communication Log: Creation of a Communication Log using any API, requires a mandatory parameter - commParentDef. The value for this parameter should be the object definition id of the record to which the Communication Log record has to be attached. For more infomation see, Communication Logs .</body>
