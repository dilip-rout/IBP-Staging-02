    <body>If you upgrade Platform Private Cloud from a prior version, Application Directory continues to be the platform to publish and distribute applications. Master tenant administrators can enable Marketplace and provide it to their customer tenants as an alternative of Application Directory. Marketplace provides more features and a better user experience to publish and distribute applications. Enabling Marketplace The following are the high-level steps for a master tenant administrator to enable and configure Marketplace: Install the Marketplace application. The Platform XML file of the application, app4-mkp.xml, is shipped with the current Platform installer. For example, if you have installed the Platform using installer, and accepted the default settings. This directory would be &lt;drive&gt;:\InfiniteBlue\Rollbase\apache-tomcat-x.x.x\rollbase\apps. The Marketplace application is made available on the master tenant and can be accessed from the application switcher. Open and configure the Marketplace application: Note: To configure and administer your Marketplace, you must understand the different sections of the Marketplace home page (see Managing the Marketplace using the Marketplace application in Platform Private Cloud ). Open the Categories object tab and create all the application categories (root, level1, and level 2) to be displayed on the Marketplace. Applications in the Marketplace must be associated with a category. Categories that do not have any associated application will not appear on the Marketplace. Open the Published Apps object tab and edit (individually) all the applications in the Published Applications list. As part of editing the application, ensure that all the application details are specified appropriately. These details will be displayed on the Marketplace's application page. Open the Carousels object tab and add carousel images to be displayed on the Marketplace home page. In the System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties &gt; Customize &gt; White Label, open and configure the MarketplaceURL property to enable Marketplace. Navigate to and test your Marketplace by selecting the Install Applications option on the Platform menu (on the top-left corner of any Platform page). Enabling the Marketplace does not automatically publish all your Application Directory's applications to the Marketplace. So, from the Published Apps menu of your Marketplace application, you must identify and approve the applications that you want to publish on the Marketplace. You can do this using the Published Apps menu of the Marketplace application (see Approving a published application in the Marketplace ). Note: Enabling Platform Marketplace disables Platform Application Directory. Disabling Marketplace To disable marketplace, comment-out or do not provide any value to the MarketplaceURL property in the System Console → System → Shared Properties → Customize → White Label.</body>
