    <body>The File Upload field type allows users to upload a file attachment that is stored in this field. The file will be opened in a new browser window when clicked by the user. The following properties can be defined while creating a File Upload field: Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Default Size — The default size of the input field shown in forms (you can override this default as a page-level property using the page editor). Maximum File Size — Specify a maximum size for files, from 128KB up to 2MB. Check Make files publicly accessible if you want the content of uploaded file be accessible without checking for a valid login session and user's access rights. If you upload a different file to a field that is publicly accessible, the URL for that file does not change. Advanced Field Properties — For more information, see Advanced field properties . Integration Name — The integration name is used to reference this field via merge fields or with Platform APIs. Field-Level Help — The Field-Level Help box allows you to define help text for the field that will appear in a popup when the user clicks the help icon next to the field. If the IsPDFAnnotationEnabled field is set to true in the System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties &gt; General &gt; Add/Remove Features , the Enable PDF Annotation checkbox assoicated with the File Upload field is visible to enable the PDF editor function on the PDF files. Note: When editing a File Upload or Image Upload file that holds a previously uploaded file, you have an option to delete that file. This action cannot be undone, even if you cancel the entire record edit operation.</body>
