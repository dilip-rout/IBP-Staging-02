    <body>This field is only available for system User objects and used to select a user's role. See Role-based access control for more information. On the field edit page, you can select the role to be used as the default for new users (No Access if no selection is made). For security reasons, a user's role can be only assigned by an administrator. For all non-administrative users, the User Role field is read-only.</body>
