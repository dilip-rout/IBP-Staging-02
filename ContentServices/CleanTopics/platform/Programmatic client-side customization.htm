    <body>Topics in this section explain how HTML event handlers, the Platform AJAX API, and the Platform JavaScript API allow you to create a customized user experience and provide a set of examples. Infinite Blue recommends that you use browser-side debugging as you develop. The JavaScript alert() method provides a simple way to debug your client-side JavaScript as you write it. Be sure to regularly monitor your browser's JavaScript errors. For Firefox, the FireBug plug-in can be useful for this purpose. If you do not have FireBug, you can use the Error Console window. Making too many AJAX calls from a UI page (for example, making them periodically with small time interval) can seriously affect the system's performance. To prevent that, the total number of AJAX API calls is limited per user's login session. The limit is 1000 calls by default, which, depending on your license, can be changed in Private Cloud installations. For detailed descriptions of the Platform AJAX APIs, see Client-side AJAX API .
