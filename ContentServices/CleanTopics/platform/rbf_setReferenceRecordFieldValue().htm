    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function sets the value of a reference field on current page with a given integration name, objectOriginalId and record ID. It will run the field's onchange event handler if there is event handling code attached to that event. This accepts objectOriginalId of the applicable objects (selected during reference field creation) only in the reference record field. Syntax rbf_setReferenceRecordFieldValue(fieldName,objectOriginalId,value) Parameters fieldName The integration name of field objectOriginalId The original ID of the object. value The selected record ID. This is an optional parameter. If this parameter is null, it sets only the value of the selected object. Note: This API is not supported in portals. Example The following example sets reference record field Reference_Record value with the objectOriginalIdp4oVeJd8SSWtoLqeGuHZOw and record ID 52974: &lt;script&gt;
(function () { rbf_setReferenceRecordFieldValue("Reference_Record","p4oVeJd8SSWtoLqeGuHZOw","52974"); }) (); &lt;/script&gt;</body>
