    <body>Surveys in portals can be a useful tool, for example, to collect customer feedback. Portal visitors are required to log in to take a survey. To add surveys to your portal: Verify that the object type associated with the survey has the Survey attribute. Create a Survey , create a survey record, and add survey questions to the record. Create an object type with both the Survey Taker and Portal User attributes. See Creating a portal user . Create some records of the Portal User object type. Create a portal page of the type Login Form and associate it with the Portal User object type. See Creating portal pages . Create a portal page of the type Take Survey. See Creating portal pages . Assign the survey record to the Take Survey portal page. The page will automatically populate the portal user's Answers field with the survey results. Assign the Take Survey portal page as a destination page from another portal page (for example, from the Login Form).</body>
