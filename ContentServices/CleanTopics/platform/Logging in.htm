    <body>Every User record has a required Email Address field. After an administrator creates a User record, the new user will receive a confirmation email with a temporary password and a login URL. Infinite Blue recommends changing passwords periodically. For Platform Private Cloud, administrators can require that passwords for their tenant meet certain criteria, such as length and inclusion of numbers. See Configuring Password Authentication for more information. For Platform Private Cloud, administrators can also require users to answer security questions as part of logging in. When security questions are enabled, users will be prompted to select security questions and provide the answers the next time they log in. Administrators create the questions, configure how many questions each user can choose, and set the number of questions a user must answer when logging in. For example, an administrator might create five security questions, require users to provide answers to three of the questions as part of their profile, and require users to answer one of the questions when logging in. See Security questions for authentication for information about configuring security questions. See Selecting and modifying your security questions for details about managing the security questions in your user profile.</body>
