    <body>When you create application objects, Platform automatically creates a set of pages that give end-users the ability to view, create, update, and delete records. You can customize pages and their components — such as sections, tabs, and fields — with HTML and JavaScript. You can also create your own pages with custom appearance and behavior. Platform uses Telerik Kendo UI, a responsive user interface framework, to create application pages. The resulting pages automatically adjust themselves for different screen widths and allows you to build one application with a modern look for all devices from full-screen browsers to smart phones. Application page types introduces the default pages Platform creates for you. When you create an object and associate it with an application, by default Platform adds a records list page for that object to the application menu bar. Users see other pages, such as the view page when they click a record, or the new record page when they click New. You can customize the user experience by choosing which actions to expose to users and what those pages contain. For example, you can add a grid component to a page. A grid component allows users to create and edit data in related records while working with a parent record. There are two general types of pages: Object pages — Pages associated with objects, including pages that list records and pages that allow you to create or edit records. Generic pages — Pages that are not associated with objects. Note: To enable Object Type Attribute for Pages, see Extending Object with Object Types .</body>
