    <body>Object relationships are similar to primary and foreign keys in a database. The type of relationships specifies cardinality (how many records of one object type can be related to another): When you create a relationship between objects, Platform automatically creates a lookup field in each object that provides access to related records. Platform also automatically creates a view for related objects that is added to the appropriate pages for both objects. End users will need to view and, in some cases, create and edit related records. Depending on the cardinality of the relationship and the permissions granted, the lookup field gives end-users the ability to view, attach, create, and remove related records. Note: To enable Object Type Attribute for Relationships, see Extending Object with Object Types .</body>
