    <body>Platform provides a rich variety of mechanisms for access control that let you specify which users have permission to access particular applications, objects, fields, and other components. These mechanisms include: Role-based access control , where you set permissions based on users' roles. User-based access control , where you set permissions for individual users. Relationship-based permissions , where you set permissions based on users' relationships to objects. Location/Department/Function (LDF) permissions , where you allow access to particular objects and/or relationships based on a hierarchical grouping of users. You can choose to use the mechanisms that best meet the needs of your application and organization. The detailed setting of all required permissions can be a tedious task, but it gives you full control over user access to all data in Platform. Platform checks permissions using the above mechanisms at the following times: When displaying applications and menus available to the current user. When displaying a list of records in a view or chart. If the user does not have access to certain records (because of relationship-based permissions or LDF), they will not be shown. When displaying a page to view or edit a particular record. If the user is trying to access a record without authorization, Platform displays an Access Denied error message: When presenting a list of records to create relationships (either in a p window or a picklist). When displaying search results. When accessing Platform through APIs. When displaying links to related records, Platform does not check permissions for the current user. Permissions are checked, however, if the user tries to navigate a related record. The following topics describe how the mechanisms work and how to implement each.</body>
