    <body>The Configuring a supported database topic explains how to create a fresh Platform database by running the default SQL creation script. If you already have data in an existing database, you can wrap these existing tables and their data into a Platform external object definition. This method allows you to use existing without impacting the underlying table or any existing applications that rely on it. External database support is available for MySQL, OpenEdge, DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline, and SQL Server databases. Platform tables must reside in the same database where existing tables you want to integrate with reside because Platform transactions are complex and often include multiple updates in several tables. Running these updates across more than one database has proven to be inefficient. Instead of creating the Platform database tables (schema in Oracle terms) in a new empty database, you will run the default Platform SQL creation script in your existing database that contains the existing tables you want to leverage. The Platform SQL creation script will add new tables, with an RB_ name prefix, without affecting existing tables. See Managing databases for more information on managing databases, Marking a database as external allows for the creation of external objects for Platform customer tenants assigned to that database.</body>
