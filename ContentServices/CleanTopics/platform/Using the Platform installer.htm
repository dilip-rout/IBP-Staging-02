    <body>If you will use Platform with an existing Web server, stop it before installing Platform. Note: If you are upgrading from a release prior to 5.0, please read Upgrading Private Cloud to Version 5.x before running the installer. To use the Platform Private Cloud installer, follow these steps: From the Platform Private Cloud Downloads Portal , download the zip file for your operating system: For Windows, INFINITE_BLUE_FULL_INSTALLER_&lt;version_number&gt;_WIN_64.zip. For Linux, INFINITE_BLUE_FULL_INSTALLER_&lt;version_number&gt;_LINUX_64.zip. Unzip the downloaded file. The resulting files include an installer executable. Run the installer in one of the following modes: Default mode, which uses a series of dialogs to guide you through the installation. See Installing Platform using the default mode for details. Console mode, which uses text-only prompts to guide you through the installation. See Installing Platform using console mode for details. Silent mode, which enables the installer to run without any user interaction. See Installing Platform using silent mode for details. If you use a Gmail server, you must set up Google OAuth 2.0 for your Platform Private Cloud instance. The procedure includes acquiring a Google Client ID and a Google Client Secret Key from a Google project. See steps 1-4 of Enabling Google Apps for Platform Private Cloud to generate the required ID and Key. The Welcome email is not sent to the first admin and an exception is thrown in the log and the console. This exception is expected as it still requires the user to authenticate with a browser the first time.
