    <body>For OpenEdge Service objects, Platform offers filtering by search criteria to enable you to construct a complex filtering criteria in OpenEdge ABL syntax. Note that filtering by search criteria is available only to the OpenEdge Service objects that implement the orderby parameter in a JSON filter string. This must be done as part of developing your JSDO catalog. For more information on the recommend parameters to be implemented in your JSDO catalog file, see Creating an application from OpenEdge data . The search criteria supports the following search conditions: String Numeric Logical Date The following table provides search examples: Search criteria examples Condition Valid Operators Search criteria or Filter clause examples String ABL operators for ABL CHAR and LONGCHAR data types Name='Girish' Name&lt;&gt;'Girish' Name BEGINS 'Gi' Name MATCHES '*ri*' NOT(Name MATCHES '*ri*') (Name='John') AND (Last-name='Lennon') (Name &lt;&gt; 'Girish' AND Name &lt;&gt; 'John' AND Name &lt;&gt; 'Lennon') Note: The name of a field in your search criteria is the field name in the JSDO catalog. That is, if the JSDO Catalog has Last-name but the Platform field name is Lastename, you must use the field name, Last-name in your search criteria. Numeric ABL operators for ABL INTEGER, INT64, and DECIMAL data types Age=20 Age&lt;&gt;20 Age&gt;=20 Age=? Age&lt;&gt;? Age=20 Age=20 Logical ABL operators for LOGICAL data types SENDNEWSLETTER=Bool SENDNEWSLETTER=NOT Bool Date ABL functions for DATE, DATETIME, and DATETIME-TZ data types DOB=DATE (04, 13,1987) UPDATEDON&lt;=TODAY ORDEREDON=DATE (OrderDate) UPDATEDON=MONTH (TODAY) DOB&lt;&gt;YEAR(DATE (04, 13,1987)) ORDERDATE=WEEKDAY (TODAY) For information on ABL operations and functions, refer to the OpenEdge ABL Reference guide in the OpenEdge documentation set.</body>
