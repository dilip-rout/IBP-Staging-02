    <body>You will receive your Platform license through email. Infinite Blue recommends saving a copy of the email message. If you are upgrading from an evaluation license, you need to edit configuration files to use the host name you supplied when purchasing the license. If you are simply renewing a license for the same host name, you can upgrade the license without restarting.</body>
