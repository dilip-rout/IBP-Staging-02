    <body>ISV accounts for both hosted and Private Cloud support white labeling functionality and give you the ability to provision and manage customer tenants directly. A customer tenant is a virtual space that securely hosts applications and data and provides a working environment for a set of users. This allows you to run your own Software as a Service (SaaS) business and take advantage of the Platform platform for rapid development and secure deployment of applications that meet critical business needs. ISV features For ISV pricing or to purchase, contact Infinite Blue . Platform provides the following benefits to all ISV customers: Reviewers: Please note that many of the details below are not listed on the website, so I had no source to verify, please check them carefully. For example, the descriptions use the term Standard to describe certain features, is that one of the ISV licensing options? What about "base" is that the same or different from "Standard"? ISV account: Hosted Platform standard customers receive a special account that provides the ability to create and manage customer tenants. This eliminates dependencies on Infinite Blue for deployment and maintenance. Platform Private Cloud customers can set up any number of ISV Accounts for their own customers. Custom login and password retrieval pages: ISVs with dedicated websites for their companies and products can host their own branded pages for log in and forgotten passwords, making the use of Platform transparent to end users. Any number of custom login pages can be created and hosted externally allowing you to have different login mechanisms for each application, dedicated login pages for key customers, or a central login for all of your customers. Custom Marketplace: You can set up a custom branded, private Marketplace or Application Directory allowing your customers and prospects to view and install applications directly from their website. Customizable platform name: It is simple to replace Platform with your own product, platform or company name. Customizable URLs: All default external links within the Platform that point to company-hosted pages, such as terms of service, privacy statement, etc, can be redirected to your pages. Hosted cloud ISV customers will still see www.infiniteblue.com in the browser address bar. Private Cloud customers will see www.yourdomain.com. Note: Starting with Platform 4.0, in hosted Platform, Marketplace replaces the Application Directory. However, for Platform Private Cloud users who have moved from earlier versions of Platform to Platform 4.0, Marketplace is provided as an alternative to the Application Directory. Administrators of the master tenant can choose Marketplace or Application Directory to publish and distribute their applications. The topics in this section describe how to work with hosted Platform or Platform Private Cloud as an ISV.</body>
