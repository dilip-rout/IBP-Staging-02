    <body>While related records show up on object view pages, grid controls can be used to edit, create, or delete related records inline on new and edit pages. This feature is particularly useful for building master-detail input, such as a quote with quote line Items, invoices, purchase orders, time, etc. Grid controls are useful for any situation in which you need an arbitrary number of line items all editable on the same page. For example, the following screen shows a grid control from a room reservation system: When adding and configuring a grid control on a new or edit page, you can define the fields shown in each row, and you can attach custom JavaScript event handling code for performing calculations and other operations when fields are updated or rows are added and deleted.
