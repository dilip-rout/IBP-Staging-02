    <body>A status represents the current state of a record. Statuses are similar to picklist values, with a special meaning in workflow. To define a new workflow status, you specify: Status Name — The display name of the workflow status (required) Integration Code — The integration code used in APIs Whether or not you want to automatically create a new corresponding workflow action to enable moving records into this new status. You can also provide a name for that new action (defaults to the status name). For each workflow process associated with the object, the workflow actions that will be available when a record has that workflow status. When you enable the Workflow attribute on an object, the system generates one default status named Created. You can change the name of this status if desired. You can then add other statuses as needed. Statuses can be assigned through workflow actions or explicitly by editing an object record. When editing an object record, statuses are presented in sequential order. You can define this order by clicking Reorder in the Workflow Statuses section of an object definition screen.</body>
