    <body>A workflow process is a container for a group of workflow statuses and actions, moving a record from one status to another. When the Workflow attribute is first set on an object definition, Platform creates one workflow process named Default. In most cases, all records follow the same workflow and it is sufficient to have only one workflow process. In some complex cases, when workflow rules are different for different records, you can define more than one workflow process. The diagram below illustrates two different processes for an order object: Small Orders and Large Orders.</body>
