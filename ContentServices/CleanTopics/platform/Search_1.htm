    <body>The search button at the top right of the screen allows you to search your tenant. To set the scope of a search, use the drop-down menu to single or multi-select the Metadata, All objects or any of the listed object type(s). The simplest way to search for data is to select the scope of the search and type a single term into the search box. When you click the search button on an application page, the following fields open. By default, the scope of a search is set to All Objects: The search fields are always available on a setup page: Object fields have a property that specifies whether or not to Index this Field as part of the text search engine. If none of an object's fields has this property checked, that object will not appear in the drop-down menu. See Advanced field properties for more information. Search queries in Platform are broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: single terms and phrases: A single term is a single word, such as Sales or Marketing. A phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes, such as "Human Resources". Platform supports advanced search syntax such as wildcard character searches and the ability to combine multiple terms together with Boolean operators to form more complex queries. Note: By default, a user will have permission to view the search button. However, if uers with a non-administrative role are not granted the Search Box permission, they cannot view the search button. See Roles and permissions for more information.</body>
