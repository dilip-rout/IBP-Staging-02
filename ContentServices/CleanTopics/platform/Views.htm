    <body>A view is a result set, a list of records that users can act on individually or in bulk. When you create an object definition, Platform creates a list view of all records of that object type. You can create additional views and apply filters to them to present a different result set. Each object definition can have any number of associated views. The view component in the object definition specifies the fields in the view and the order in which they appear. Most columns are sortable, depending on their type. Usually the record name column is included in a view so that users can click the name to view record details. See Working with views for details. The total number of records in a list view is based on the permissions granted to the viewer. In complex cases, such as when the Location, Department, and Function permissions model is enabled, the number of records is not shown to avoid overextending resources. Users can also apply and remove temporary filters. See a sample view and the default set of controls . To create or modify a view: Specify fields, their order, row colors, and filter criteria in the object definition view component . Specify the controls available to end users and other page characteristics in the view page . Note: To enable Object Type Attribute for Views, see Extending Object with Object Types .</body>
