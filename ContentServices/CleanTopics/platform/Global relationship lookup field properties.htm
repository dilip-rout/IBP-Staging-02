    <body>In addition to page-level settings defined in the page editor, lookup fields have global properties. You can set these properties when editing a lookup field from an object definition: Links Alignment — Choose how links should be aligned on view pages and in views: Horizontal (default) or Vertical. Hide "Quick Create" button for this field — Check this box if you want to hide the button used to create and select a new related record rather than choosing an existing one. Note that the Quick Create button is not available (regardless of the global setting) in the following cases: If the user does not have permissions to create a new record of the related type In pop-up pages, such as Print Preview, and in portal pages In Quick Create pages For relationships with 1-1 or N-1 cardinality where the related record is already selected Main Lookup and Link Lookup — Limits the available choices for this (link) lookup field to be consistent with the current selection in another (main) lookup field. See Restricting records for lookup fields for more information. Autocomplete Field — Select the field to be used to find matches when users start typing in the lookup field. After you type three characters, Platform starts displaying matches automatically for the user to select as desired. Autocomplete Rule: Select Starts With or Contains to change the matching behavior of the autocomplete feature. Default Value — Optionally select a record to be selected in this field by default when users create new records. Track all changes to this field in each record's Audit Trail for a complete historical log — Check this property to automatically add a record-level audit trail entry whenever the field is updated. This option is only available if the parent object has Audit Trail property. See Auditing for more information. Always require a value in this field in order to save a record — Check this property if you want the field to be required.</body>
