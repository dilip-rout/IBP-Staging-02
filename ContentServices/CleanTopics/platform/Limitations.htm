    <body>The following limitations apply when creating Platform external objects associated with OpenEdge Data Objects: OpenEdge Data Objects are only certified with Progress OpenEdge 11.3.2, 11.3.3, 11.5, 11.5.1, and 11.6. Only single-table data sets can map to a Platform external object. Platform creates objects with fields that match OpenEdge resource columns. If a field has a name that cannot be used in Platform, such as a field that contains hyphens, it will be skipped. Arrays in OpenEdge are not imported. OpenEdge Data Objects do not support the following object attributes available in Platform: Organization Portal User Approval Survey Survey Taker Queue For information about the object attributes that an OpenEdge Data Object supports, see Enabling object attributes for an OpenEdge Data Object . Relationships involving OpenEdge Data Objects support only the following scenarios: 1-1 or 1-N cardinality when establishing a relationship between an OpenEdge Data Object and another OpenEdge Data Object or a Platform native object 1-1 or N-1 cardinality when establishing a relationship between a Platform native object and an OpenEdge Data Object. JSDO supports an Invoke method apart from CRUD operations. Accessing this Invoke method from Platform Object script requires a Client Principal token. This token is “{!#CP_TOKEN}”, and can be used in an HTTP header under the header name ‘X-OE-CLIENT-CONTEXT-ID’. Example: var headers = { 'X-OE-CLIENT-CONTEXT-ID' : '{!#CP_TOKEN}'
};
