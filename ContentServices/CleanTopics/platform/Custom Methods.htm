    <body>A custom method is a JavaScript code execution runtime that allows you to customize the behavior of requests to your backend by providing a means to implement server-side business logic. It enables developers to focus on the unique functional business logic of the application, while the platform handles the work of receiving, parsing, and routing requests, connecting to and querying data. Custom Methods can be used for the following: Optimizing the data exchange by joining multiple objects. Validating app user actions in order to enforce business rules. Providing a means to host platform agnostic code and save development time on multi-platform apps. Custom methods enables citizen developers to expose their custom business logic as REST API using the OpenAPI standards from the Platform. It helps to integrate their application with any external systems with less complexity. This feature supports the Roles &amp; User-based Permissions with Platform API authentication which can be configured by administrator. Apart from the above mentioned, Custom Methods in Platform also supports GET, POST, PUT or DELETE HTTP&#160;verb methods and java script hosted files for invoking common functionality.
