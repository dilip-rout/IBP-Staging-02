    <body>This trigger sends an email based on an email template. Alternatively, you can select an email template field to use per record (this provides a way to dynamically determine which email template to use based on a field value in the record). Note: You must create at least one email template for a given object definition to create this type of trigger. See Email templates for more information. Apart from the common trigger settings described above, you must select the recipient email address (and, optionally, CC and BCC recipients). This can be a specific address (you can use the popup selector to choose one), or an email address stored in one of the record's fields (use the Use Field helper). You must also select the email template or email template field to use. You can also type in text and formula fields which return one or group of (separated by space, comma, or semicolon) valid email addresses. You can also specify whether the Reply To field in a trigger-generated email should contain the email address of the current user, the default auto-reply email address (defined in the Account Settings page), or an explicitly specified email address. Note: Reply To field is not applicable for Exchange Server. The exchange server overrides the Reply To field value.</body>
