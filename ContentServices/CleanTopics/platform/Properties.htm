    <body>The properties described in this section allow you to set certain user interface behaviors. Some of these properties must be set in a custom sidebar script that executes before the user interface starts. See Executing a script before the UI starts for details. Note: The properties in this section apply to the new UI, not the classic UI. Most Platform tenants are using the new UI. However, tenants on older Private Cloud installations might still be using the classic UI. These properties are not supported in portals.</body>
