    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function runs a SQL SELECT query on the server and returns a single decimal number to the callback function. This is a simplified version of rbf_selectValue suitable for calculating totals etc. The current user must have View permission on the selected object type to run this API. The SELECT query used in this method consists of the following parts: The SELECT statement expects columns or expressions to be selected (mandatory). Use the field integration names as SQL column names. You can use expressions such as COUNT(1). You cannot use * to retrieve all columns. The FROM clause must consist of exactly one object name (mandatory). The WHERE clause can include a valid SQL expression to narrow the selection (optional). Use field integration names as SQL column names. The ORDER BY clause can include a valid SQL expression to order the selection (optional). Use field integration names as SQL column names. You can use special tokens in your queries such as: TODAY for current time WEEK for 12PM of last Sunday MONTH for 12PM of 1st day of current month QUARTER for 12PM of 1st day of current quarter YEAR for 12PM of 1st day of current year CURR_USER for id of currently logged in user Object and Field names are case-sensitive, while other components of the SQL query are not. Use #code suffix to fetch integration codes for picklist fields rather than IDs. See Adding business logic for more information. Syntax rbf_selectNumber(query, callback) Parameters query SQL SELECT query. callback A callback function that will receive a single value returned by the query. Note: This API is supported in portals as well.</body>
