    <body>Purpose For generic pages with two columns, this property allows you to specify whether the sections in the left and right columns align with each other. If set to true, each left/right pair of sections will align at the top. If set to false (the default), sections in each column take up the available space after the sections above them. The example below illustrates how this works on a generic page with two columns and four sections. Note: This property applies to the new UI, not the classic UI. Most Platform tenants are using the new UI. However, tenants on older Private Cloud installations might still be using the classic UI. This property is not supported in portals. With this property set to true, the sections Report Left and Report Right are aligned at the top: With this property set to true, the sections Report Left and Report Right maintain their alignment when the Title Chart Right section is collapsed: With this property set to false, the sections Report Left and Report Right are positioned with respect to the chart sections in their columns: With this property set to false, collapsing the Title Chart Right section causes the Report Right section to move into the available space: Fully qualified name rb.newui.options.genericPage.leftRightSectionPairStartsNewRow Example The following code sets this property to true. This results in the behavior illustrated in the first two screens above. &lt;script&gt; rb.newui.options.genericPage.leftRightSectionPairStartsNewRow = true; &lt;/script&gt;</body>
