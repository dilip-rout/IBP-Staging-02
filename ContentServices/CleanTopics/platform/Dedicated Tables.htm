    <body>Dedicated Tables Beta Introduction The platform instance has a mandatory master database for storing the master data. For more information, see Managing databases . Tenant data can be stored in the same master database. Alternatively the MASTER Admin can configure a separate tenant database to host tenant(s) data. Until Platform v5.12, the tenant(s) object data is stored in a single data table called RB_OBJ_DATA. Dedicated tables allows the Tenant Admin to create separate tables for specific objects that have the following requirements: High volume or frequency of data import along with Unique field constraints Need for custom indices for better performance. Dedicated tables allows the integrity checks to be offloaded from the application server to the database. It also removes the constraints on the column indexing, imposed due to the design of the RB_OBJ_DATA table. This significantly improves the performance of the candidate objects. Limitations Dedicated tables is currently limited to non-master tenants only. This functionality currently only caters to non-system objects. Dedicated tables currently does not support unique data for URL fields. Once an object and data is migrated to a dedicated table, it cannot be reverted to the shared object table. Either a new object can be created, or an existing object can be migrated and hosted on a dedicated table. See Creating a New Object on a Dedicated Table and Migrating an existing object to a dedicated table for more information.</body>
