    <body>Object Type also enables the platform with “Record Type” capability. By enabling an object with the “Object type” attribute, you can create multiple object types within an object. This allows the app developers to have records specific to that object type where all the fields are a combination of inherited default type fields and fields defined for the type. The app developer can also have multiple Create, Edit, View, and other pages specific for each object type. For example, “Issue” is the object with multiple object types within issues like “Epic”, “Bug”, “Story” etc. An application can have a specific “Object Type” attached to many object types within an object. This provides the flexibility of choosing specific types for a specific application. The selection of these “Object Type” within the application definition allows the “Object Type” to be available in the record creation option on runtime for an object. Quick Create Quick create option is also based on the selected object type (as core objects) for the application. Record Type - Pages for Object Type The object “Issue” has “Epic”, “Bug”, “Story” and “Testcase”. So each object type can have different Create, Edit, View, etc. pages. Epic Create Page Story Create Page Bug Create Page Record Type - Views for Object Type Similar to the pages, multiple views can also be created for any “Object Type”. Each view is in the context of that object type records only and can show fields from the “Default” type and corresponding object type. All Types View There is a system-defined view that is generated to display “All Type” records. This is a special view that cannot be deleted but the app developer has the privilege to modify the selection of fields for this view. As this view shows all records from different object types, the fields which are available in this view for selection are only from the “Default” object type as default type fields are available across all the object types. Notes: All types view is a special view with special capabilities, thus it has the following limitation: This view is limited to “Default” type fields only. There are limited options available in “More action” drop-down. This view cannot be deleted. It can be deleted/removed only by disabling the “Object Type” attribute for the object. Mass update for this view is allowed only on “Default” type fields. Default Views for Object Types The app developer can create as many views as they would prefer to create but on the creation of each “Object Type”, a view “All &lt;Object type&gt;” is auto-generated for all records for the corresponding object type. These views can be further customized by app developer for their usage. “More Action” on All &lt;Object Type&gt;: These views support all actions, similar to any the general object. Mass Update pages of default type and view's type are shown.</body>
