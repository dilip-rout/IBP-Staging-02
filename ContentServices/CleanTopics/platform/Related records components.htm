    <body>Related records components are used to display a list of related records for objects with 1-many or many-many relationships. For example, if you have an room object with a one-to-many relationship with furnishings, the room view page can contain a related record component: Related record components are only shown on view pages for specific records and automatically filter the data displayed to only show those records that are related to the current record being viewed. You can use the page editor to define whether or not you want to hide or show controls of the related record component such as Quick Create and New. See Editing pages for more information. You can also use the page editor to define which view should be shown by default. For more information on creating and configuring views, see Views .</body>
