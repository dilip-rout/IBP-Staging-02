    <body>Platform renders text in reports from left to right (LTR). Unlike on application pages, Platform does not automatically set the text direction based on the language. However, you can edit your report content to render some or all text from right to left (RTL). The method for supporting RTL text in a report depends on the type of report: Tabular report — Platform automatically renders text in the correct direction based on the user's language and requires no additional configuration. Document template report — A document template report is based on a document template; how you configure the text direction depends on the type of document template. See Document templates for details. HTML report — Use the dir attribute and the bdi element as described in Document templates to format the text direction of the HTML content. Users can render HTML reports as PDF. To render PDF content as RTL, use the dir attribute in the body element of the base HTML. JavaScript report — Platform automatically renders text in the correct direction based on the language used in the report and requires no additional configuration. Custom report — You can define your own style for custom reports in two general ways: To render an entire report as RTL, either select an existing stylesheet that renders text as RTL when creating the report, or add body {direction: rtl;} in the Styling Properties area. See Selecting a Custom Report Type for details about adding a stylesheet and styles to a custom report. To render a section of a report as RTL, add the styling directly to the section. For example, you can modify the div element of an HTML Template section to add the style attribute as shown below: &lt;div class='rbs-cr-htmlSection' style='direction:rtl'&gt; مرحبا &lt;/div&gt; For more information about language support, see Language support .</body>
