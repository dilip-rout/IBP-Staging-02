    <body>Once you have enabled Google integration for your Platform account (see Enabling Google integration ), you will have the option to export your views as spreadsheets in Google Sheets (in addition to Excel spreadsheets, CVS files, and PDF documents). See Exporting from views and reports for more information. To export a view to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, select Google when exporting a view. All of the data in your view will be displayed as a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets. This gives you the convenience of Google Sheets to work with and analyze your data, including the ability to share your data with other users who may not have access to your Platform applications.</body>
