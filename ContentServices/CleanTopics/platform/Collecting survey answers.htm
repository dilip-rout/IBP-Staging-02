    <body>Platform saves survey results. You can view them along with the record associated with the person taking the survey. On the record view page you will find a Survey Answers component use the page editor to add it if it is not automatically added to your view page. Reviewers: When I added the Survey Taker attribute to my User object, the view page contained a "Person Taking Survey" section with Survey Score, Rank, and Answers fields. When I clicked Design this page, I also see the Survey Answers component as described here. Is this changed functionality? And, isn't there a way to get collated results? This would be impossible to use if I had to navigate to each individual's answers.</body>
