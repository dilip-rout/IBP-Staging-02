    <body>Field-level help provides a popup window to help end-users. You can implement field-level help per application as follows: Navigate to the application settings, and edit the application definition to set the Enable field-level help for this application property. Enter help text in the Field-Level Help box. You can use HTML tags to format the text, such as &lt;br/&gt; to control line breaks. On object pages, a ? icon displays next to fields for which help has been defined. Roll your cursor over the icon or click it to display the help text.</body>
