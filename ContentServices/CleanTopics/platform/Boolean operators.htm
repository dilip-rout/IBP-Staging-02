    <body>Boolean operators allow you to combine search terms. Platform supports AND, +, OR, NOT and -. The operators must be entered in capital letters as shown. Operator Description Example OR The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. If there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the search uses OR. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching record if either of the terms exists in record fields or file attachments. This is equivalent to a union using sets. You can use the || symbol instead of the word OR. For example, to search for records that contain either "Human Resources" or just "Human" use the query: "Human Resources" Human or "Human Resources"OR Human. AND The AND operator matches records where both terms exist somewhere in one or more record fields or file attachments. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. You can use the &amp;&amp; symbol instead of the word AND. To search for documents that contain "Human Resources" and "Sales" use the query: "Human Resources"ANDSales + The + required operator requires that the term after the + symbol exists somewhere in a single record field or in one of its file attachments. For example, to search for records that must contain "Human" and may contain "Resources" use the query: +Human Resources NOT The NOT operator excludes records with fields or file attachments that contain the term after NOT. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. You can use the ! symbol instead of the word NOT. Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results: NOTSales For example, to search for records that contain "Human Resources" but not "Sales" use the query: "Human Resources"NOTSales - The - prohibit operator excludes records with fields or file attachments that contain the term after the - symbol. To search for records that contain "Human Resources" but not "Sales", use the query: "Human Resources"-Sales</body>
