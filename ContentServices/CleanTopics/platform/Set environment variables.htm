    <body>The &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt; environment variable should point at your Platform installation, the directory containing Platform config and res folders. The JRE_HOME variable should point at the jre folder of your Java installation. If you used the Platform installer, it creates and sets these variables for you. This topic describes how to set these variables on hosts with Windows and Linux operating systems. On Windows Machines To set the &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt; environment variable on a host with a Windows OS: In Windows Explorer, right-click Computer or My Computer and select Properties. Click Advanced System Settings. Click Environment Variables. Under the list of System variables, click New Enter &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt; for the Variable name and the full path to the root directory of your Platform installation for the Variable value. For example, if you unzipped rollbase.zip in a C:\InfiniteBlue directory, the path would be C:\InfiniteBlue\Rollbase. Click OK. Under the list of System variables, click New Enter JRE_HOME for the Variable name and the path to the jre directory of your Java installation for Variable value. For example, if the Java installation is in C:\Java, the path would be C:\Java\jre&lt;version&gt;. On Linux Machines On Linux or UNIX based machines use the commands ROLLBASE_HOME= and JRE_HOME=. For example, using the bash shell and assuming a location of usr/share/rollbase, the command would be as follows: export ROLLBASE_HOME=/usr/share/rollbase</body>
