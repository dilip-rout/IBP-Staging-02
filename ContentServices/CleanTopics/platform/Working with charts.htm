    <body>You can use charts in Platform to visually represent a snapshot of your data. Charts support a wide variety of styles: bar, column, pie, donut, and many others. Charts can periodically and automatically refresh themselves without a complete page refresh. Some charts provide drill-down capabilities and interactivity options such as rotation and slice movement. Charts are responsive and are auto-scaled to fit the available space. Auto-scaling is done only if the available space is less than the configured chart dimensions. Otherwise, the chart will always be rendered with the configured dimensions. Platform offers two engines to render charts: FusionCharts (based on HTML) Google Charts (based on HTML) Note: Single Series Grid is no longer supported by FusionCharts v3.13.0. Following which in Platform v5.9, the Grid style Fusion chart doesn't execute. Furthermore in Platform v5.10, Grid style is removed from the new Fusion chart creation list.</body>
