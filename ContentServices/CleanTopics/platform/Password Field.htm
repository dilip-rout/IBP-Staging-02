    <body>With the Password Field type, users can enter and securely store passwords for authentication of Portal Users or for any other purpose, such as integration with third-party systems. You can define the following properties: Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Minimum Length — Minimum length (number of characters) password may have. An optional checkbox to enable if password must contain both letters and digits. Advanced Field Properties — For more information, see Advanced field properties . Integration Name — The integration name is used to reference this field via merge fields or with Platform APIs. Field-Level Help — The Field-Level Help box allows you to define help text for the field that will appear in a popup when the user clicks the help icon next to the field. For security reasons passwords are encrypted when stored internally. Actual password's value is never displayed on UI pages. The decision to display password’s value at AJAX, REST, or SOAP is governed through the View Integration Password permission. The password's value is always accessible through formulas and Server Side API’s. See Roles and permissions for more information. When user is entering password on New Record or Edit page he/she is required to confirm entered value by re-typing it again in text box below. If password is already stored in the system it is not populated in text boxes for security reasons. Instead there is a note "Password on file" below text boxes. Provide a new value to override password on file. Use "Remove" link to clear password's value without providing a new value.</body>
