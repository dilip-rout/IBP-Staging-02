    <body>The administrator of a customer tenant can allow master tenant users to access its environment for a specified duration. Typically, if a customer tenant requires that the master users troubleshoot a problem in its account, the customer tenant gives access to the master users for them to rectify the problem. After getting the access, the master user can access the customer details page and log into the customer tenant. For more information about how master users log into a customer tenant, see Working with customer records . To enable a master tenant to log into a customer tenant: Navigate to the Setup home page: From an application page, do one of the following: Select Setup Home from the Platform menu . Select Setup Home from the application switcher . Under the Administration Setup options, select Support Access. The Support Access page opens. Click Edit to modify the support access settings in your tenant. Select Enable to allow master users to access and log into all the users in your customer tenant. Specify, in the Give Access for field, the duration for which you want to grant the access. Click Save.</body>
