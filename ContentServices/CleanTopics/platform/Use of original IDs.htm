    <body>When you distribute an application to be installed in other Platform tenants, Platform creates new IDs for all application components. Platform uses these local IDs to manage application updates. Each application component and subcomponent has a unique local ID within a tenant, and a unique Original ID, which is guaranteed to be unique across all tenants. You must design your application to use original IDs and tokens, not the local ID. For example: Use integration codes for picklist items and workflow statuses in formula fields, templates and triggers; do not use IDs. Use template tokens such as Link to View Page{!#LINK.order} or a reference to the id, such as {!id}. Do not explicitly use IDs in Template Fields or Integration Link Fields (used to build dynamic URLs). The System Information section of component definitions contains the local ID and the Original ID. To find a component's Original ID, do the following: From the application switcher, select Setup Home. From the Applications Setup area, click the type of component (For example, Applications, Objects, or Tabs). Click the name of the component. The component definition displays. For object subcomponents, scroll down to the appropriate section and click the subcomponent name. The component's properties displays the System Information section with local and original IDs: The Original ID of an entity can also be captured from the Object Definition page.</body>
