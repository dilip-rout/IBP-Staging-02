    <body>By default, customers in a multi-server environment are loaded dynamically to any available production server. An administrator logged into the master tenant can change this behavior by assigning any number of customers to a specific production server. Import jobs running on the Production server Import jobs executed on the Production server provide the following benefits when compared to running these on the Storage server: Cache — In a Production server, most data is cached to minimize database access. The Storage server does not have the benefit of this cache, which resulted in more database access and affected performance. Import jobs running in the Production server can take advantage of cached data and minimize database access OpenEdge Data Objects — When an import job imports data into OpenEdge Data Objects, it requires a password to authenticate to OpenEdge. The OpenEdge password is cached in the Production server but is not available to the Storage server, which would result in an import failure. Import jobs running in the Production server have access to the OpenEdge password and can successfully import data into OpenEdge Data Objects. Concurrent Import Jobs — Import jobs are limited to one thread per component they run on. If you have configured multiple Storage servers to have parallel import jobs, there is no longer any benefit in configuring multiple Storage servers. Configuring multiple Production servers to load balance requests, including import jobs, is the recommended approach to improve throughput. You can still configure multiple Storage servers to load balance file/image access across the cluster and to segregate customer file data. To assign customers to a dedicated server: From the application switcher, navigate to System Console &gt; Components.The Components page appears. Click the Edit link associated with the production server. The Edit Component Details dialog appears. Select the IsDedicated checkbox to dedicate the production server and Save the changes. Edit the customer records for the customers you want to assign to the production server: Select the Customers tab. Select the appropriate customer and click Edit. Scroll down to the Zone Properties section: Note: In case, the Dedicated Server field is not visible, click Page Options &gt; Design This Page and drag-drop the Dedicated Servercomponent from the Available Components panel to the Edit Page and Save the changes. From the Dedicated Server drop-down list, select the production server to assign for this customer. Click Save.</body>
