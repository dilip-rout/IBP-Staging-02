    <body>Note: Starting with Platform 4.2, Platform Private Cloud includes a beta quality open source library-based implementation. Platform uses Aspose.Words for Java to process Word-based document templates. To use Aspose.Words for Java with Platform Private Cloud, do the following: Download and purchase Aspose.Words for Java 14.8.0 from: http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.words-for-java/default.aspx . Optionally, if you have a previous version of Aspose.Words for Java, you must remove the related .jar and .lic files from your Platform installation. Copy aspose-words-14.8.0-jdk16.jar into the Web server lib directory. For example, if you used the installer, installed PAS, and accepted the default folder, this location would be Progress\Rollbase\Pas_Instance\common\lib. Else the location is InfiniteBlue\Rollbase\apache-tomcat-x.x.x\rollbase\lib. Copy the Aspose.Words.lic license file into the config directory of your Platform installation. For example, if you used the installer, installed PAS, and accepted the default folder, this location would be Progress\Rollbase\Pas_Instance\rollbase\config. Else the location is InfiniteBlue\Rollbase\apache-tomcat-x.x.x\rollbase\config. Restart PAS or Tomcat.</body>
