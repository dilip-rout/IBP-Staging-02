    <body>Infinite Blue periodically provides Private Cloud software updates for download. To check on updates, go to this page: Platform Private Cloud Downloads Portal , and log in using your Private Cloud download account. Some updates require you to also run update scripts on your database(s). If you customize the look and feel of application web pages, updates might replace your resource files with Platform resources. It is your responsibility to maintain your resource customizations.</body>
