    <body>To use the Amazon S3 service for file storage, you need to have an S3 subscription and you must have at least one bucket, your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You can retrieve the S3 ID and S3 Key values for your AWS account by logging in and navigating to the Security Credentials screen. Working with S3 storage For further details on adding a Amazon S3 storage and assigning it to the customer, refer File Storages and Creating a new customer record . Note: If you want to move your existing customer storage from cloud-cloud, local-cloud, or cloud-local, refer Working with customer records for more details. In the case of migration to Platform 5.4, for the ISV Partner and System Console applications, under the customer objects, it is recommended to delete the fields (S3 Bucket, S3 ID/Account Name, S3 Key/Account Key, Cloud Storage) due to security reasons. The mentioned fields are no longer required by the system. Currently, Platform supports only slash (/) as the delimiter for the bucket name.</body>
