    <body>Templates used on portal pages sometimes use URLs to other portal pages. To simplify portal development, Platform provides template helpers, which, for each page, can generate a token that represents: The page's URL A link to the page The page's ID To generate a portal page's URL using the template helper: Open the Page Properties page by doing one of the following: From the portal view, in the table of portal pages, click Properties in the row of the page you want to view or edit. From the portal page view, select Properties from the More actions drop-down menu. The Page Properties page opens. The HTML Events Handlers section of this page includes the Template Helper: From the first drop-down field (Title in the above graphic), select the portal for which you want to create the page's URL: From the next drop-down field, select pageName[URL]: The Template Helper displays the token to use for the page's URL: For Generic or List pages, you can use this token directly in user interface templates. For a View or Edit page, which displays a single record, you must add the ID of the record being edited or viewed. To do so, append the URL's id parameter to the token: {!#PORTAL.125233463.125233479#url}&amp;id={!id} At runtime, the token resolves to the page's URL. You can also use URL tokens pointing to portal pages in email templates.</body>
