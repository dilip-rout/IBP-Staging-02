    <body>As with most websites, in portals you often need to make use of and reference files such as images, Flash movies, JavaScript, CSS, etc. These files are typically referenced in web pages through &lt;IMG&gt;, &lt;SCRIPT&gt; and other HTML tags. Platform provides a convenient way to host and reference arbitrary files through a mechanism called Hosted Files. For example, using this feature, you can upload and use third party and custom JavaScript and CSS libraries in your portals to create a unique user experience and look and feel. JavaScript hosted files can be very useful in development of both client-side and server-side scripts. You can preview these files while working in the formula editor using the drop-down list View JS Hosted Files. Hosted files can be included as part of published applications just like other application components (e.g. portals, objects, etc.) Hosted files are most often used in portal pages, but they can also be used in Platform object pages. You can prepare a CSS Stylesheet with all tags used by the Platform UI (see Platform CSS Styles for the Classic UI ) and upload this CSS as hosted file. In this case, you could use hosted CSS to customize the appearance of all pages in your tenant. For information on hosting CSS, see Advanced setup and administration . You can reference hosted files using merge fields in various scenarios such as in template and formula fields, HTML and script components in pages, as well as within email and document templates. Using hosted file tokens in email templates provides a convenient way to add email attachments. See Hosted file tokens and Using hosted file tokens for more information.</body>
