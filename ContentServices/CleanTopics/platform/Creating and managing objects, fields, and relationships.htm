    <body>If you use the Quick Create wizard to create an application, you can create objects, fields, and relationships between objects when you create the application. You can also create a new object definition in the context of an application, or from the list of available objects in setup. There are two types of objects in an application: Core objects will be published and installed with the application, should you decide to distribute it in XML format. Core objects are explicitly assigned in the application edit page. When you create a new object with a tab, it becomes a core object by default. Dependent objects are pre-requisites for applications: they must be installed prior to installing the application. Dependent objects can be explicitly assigned in the application edit page as well. However, the system will automatically add objects as dependent objects to maintain the application's integrity in the following cases: The User object is always included as a dependent object for all applications. If any core objects have the Approval attribute, the Approval object will be added as a dependent object. Any object associated with a tab which is not included as core. Topics in this section describe how to work with Platform objects, fields, and relationships.</body>
