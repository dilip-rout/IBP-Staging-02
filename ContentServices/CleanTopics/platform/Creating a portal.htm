    <body>Follow these steps to create a portal: From the Setup Application page for your application, select Portals from the ribbon. The page scrolls to the Portals section: Click New Portal. The New Portal page opens: Enter the following information: Portal Name: Give the portal a descriptive name. Integration Name: Enter an Integration Name. The Integration Name should be unique across the tenant. Is Deployed: Exposes the portal to external access; keep this box unchecked until the portal is ready to use. Field-Level Help: If checked, a ? icon displays next to fields and contains any field-level help you have defined. "Powered by" Logo: Check this box to include a Powered by Infinite Blue Platform logo at the bottom of portal pages. AJAX Calls for non-authenticated portal users: If this box is checked, AJAX calls will be allowed to this portal without authentication. Depending on where and how the portal is deployed, this can be a security risk. Use this option carefully. AJAX Calls for authenticated portal users: If this box is checked, AJAX calls will be allowed to this portal with authentication. Bootstrap Version: Select a bootstrap version to be used during runtime of a portal page. Only users who have an administrator role have the permission to make a selection. Note: By default, when you create a new portal, Bootstrap version v2.3.1 is selected. If an existing portal had the Use Bootstrap v3 option checked, the bootstrap version v3.3.7 will be automatically applied to retain the selection. If an existing portal had the Use Bootstrap v3 option unchecked, the bootstrap version v2.3.1 will be applied. From Platform version 6.3 onwards, the available bootstrap options are v2.3.1, v3.3.7, v4.x, and v5.x. When you export or import an application the bootstrap version selected for a portal is retained. When you select a bootstrap version (3 or above) and opt to use CDN, the bootstrap files are loaded from CDN. Include Kendo UI: If this box is checked, Platform will add Kendo UI-related CSS and JS files for the portal. If you only want to use a few Kendo UI features, leave this box unchecked and include only the files required for those features. This will result in a lighter page that loads faster. For example, currently the entire Kendo UI library is 2,594KB and the two color picker JS files total 33KB. See http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui for more information. Right to Left Text Direction: If this box is checked, Platform will use right-to-left text direction. This is intended for portals that use a language written from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. This is an experimental feature. Language: Select the language for the portal pages. Date Format: Select the date format to use in this portal in display and input fields. Time Zone: Select the time zone for this portal. All date/time field values will be adjusted to this time zone. Description: Provide a description for this portal. Login URL: Use this setting only for portals embedded into other websites that require authentication. This is the URL for logging into the portal. Add to Applications: Select the applications to which this portal will be added. Click Save. Platform creates the portal and a new, empty generic page that is the default main portal page. Depending on your requirements, you can edit this page to add content to it, or you can assign a different main page to the portal and delete this page. Create portal pages for the portal. If you are planning to use a portal as part of your website--rather than embedding it in one of your website's pages using an HTML iframe--configure the header and footer to adopt the look and feel of your site. See Creating a custom header and footer for more information. Configure Portal security .</body>
