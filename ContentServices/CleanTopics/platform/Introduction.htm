    <body>Infinite Blue® Platform is a fully functional version that you can download, install and host on your own servers or on another cloud platform. A Private Cloud system includes all of the design and runtime functionality of hosted Platform. Platform Private Cloud supports single server and multi-server deployments, as defined by your license. Private cloud end-users can be individuals or departments within your organization or others to whom you sell Platform applications and services. You can create separate tenants to keep sets of applications separate and secure for different groups of users. Each customer tenant will have its own login account. Evaluating Platform You can evaluate Platform Private Cloud as long as you want at no cost. You simply register, download and install the software with no license. Without a license, Platform enforces the following limitations: Every page displays the notification, Free Platform Evaluation. A maximum of one database instance (MySQL, OpenEdge, DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline, MS SQL Server, or Oracle) and one Platform instance A maximum of two Customers tenants, with two User accounts and 5000 object records (total for all objects) in each tenant. Infinite Blue Technical Support only provides answers to installation-related questions. However, you can join Infinite Blue Community Platform Technical Users forums, which provide answers to a variety of questions. Runtime Architecture Platform Private Cloud requires the following runtime components: One or more Java Web application server instances to which Platform components are deployed (The installer includes the Progress Application Server (PAS)). PAS is based on Apache Tomcat® but is tailored to be secure for use in production systems. PAS also simplifies the process required to create and run multiple Platform components on different hosts. Each PAS shares the executables and libraries of a common Tomcat server, but each instance is a separate process, running in a separate JVM, with its own configuration, such as for ports, security framework, and Web applications. One or more database instances. The database can be on its own host or be collocated with Platform components. The following image illustrates a single server Platform Private Cloud architecture with Platform auxiliary components identified in the call-out. If you choose not to use PAS, you will need to install and configure your Web server to work optimally with Platform. Since Infinite Blue certifies use of Apache Tomcat with Platform, the documentation provides PAS and Tomcat-specific information. If you are using another Web server, refer to that documentation to find the equivalent functionality. The multi-server architecture supports multiple instances of all components, which can be distributed for performance and scalability. See Planning your multi-server architecture The first Platform instance you install is a Master Server, from which you can: Create and manage customers (tenants). Monitor system components. Setup ISV partners. Manage a shared applications directory and a support portal. Run applications for your own business, such as CRM, bug tracking, and customer support. See Administration for more information. Infinite Blue offers the following installation package options: The Platform Private Cloud installer for Microsoft® Windows and Linux operating systems. In addition to Platform, you can optionally install an OpenEdge database, and the Pacific App Server, a pre-configured instance of Tomcat. See Using the Platform installer . Zipped packages allow advanced users to install Platform components manually. This method of installation works best for multi-server environments or for operating systems not supported by the Private Cloud Installer. See Setting up Platform manually .</body>
