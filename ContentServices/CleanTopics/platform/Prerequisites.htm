    <body>Before you can download and install Platform Private Cloud: You will need a Platform Private Cloud download account . All hosts on which you plan to install Platform must have Java installed. The Private Cloud installer will install a JRE for you. If you are doing a manual install, download and install the latest version of the Oracle Java 8 runtime environment from www.oracle.com . If you are going to use Platform with an existing Web server, make sure that the Web server is stopped and not restarted until you finish the entire installation process. If you've installed Tomcat as a Windows service, run tomcat&lt;version&gt;.exe to stop the service (or navigate to the Services panel to stop it manually).
