    <body>You can use triggers to send HTTP Get and Post requests and send SMS messages. Processing Responses from HTTP Triggers After the HTTP response is retrieved by GET, POST, or SMS Trigger, the system stores two values and makes them available for subsequent Triggers through the getSharedValue() API (see rbv_api.getSharedValue() ): Name Value Example ReturnStatus HTTP Status rbv_api.getSharedValue("ReturnStatus") ReturnBody HTTP Body rbv_api.getSharedValue("ReturnBody") For example: Create an HTTP GET or HTTP POST trigger. Create an Object Script and configure it to run immediately after HTTP trigger. Use the following API calls in Object Script trigger: var code = rbv_api.getSharedValue("ReturnStatus"); var body = rbv_api.getSharedValue("ReturnBody"); Now you can analyze HTTP return code and response's body and perform appropriate action. Tip: You can create powerful integrations by sending HTTP requests and then processing the results in a subsequent Object Script Trigger. Please note that second etc. HTTP call will override shared values set on the first call. Store these values in intermediate variables if you need to preserve them.</body>
