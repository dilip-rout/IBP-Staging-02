    <body>With the Date/Time field, users can enter a date and a time, or pick a date from a calendar popup. When the user selects a date from the calendar popup, Platform enters that date and the current time into the Date/Time field. You can define the following properties: Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Default Size — The default size of the input field shown in forms (you can override this default as a page-level property using the page editor).
