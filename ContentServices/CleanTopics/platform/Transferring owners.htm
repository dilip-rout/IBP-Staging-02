    <body>If an object has a relationship with the built-in User object, records can be associated with a particular user. Click Transfer Owners in the group actions menu to quickly change the ownership of the selected records from one user to another. This option is only available if the object definition has at least one relationship with the User object. Note: Only single cardinality user relationships are eligible for ownership transfer.</body>
