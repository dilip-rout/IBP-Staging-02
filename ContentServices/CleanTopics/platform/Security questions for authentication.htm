    <body>Often security provided by password-based login is insufficient for customers, especially in the financial sector. In this case, an administrator can set up security questions. After providing the correct login name and password, a user must answer selected question(s) before proceeding to application pages. Security questions are asked: After a user logs into Platform without a secure cookie. When a user's password is reset. When a user has changed answers to security questions. When a password expires (if an expiration policy was set). If a secure cookie was deleted or has expired. Security questions for authentication are only available when the authentication method is Password or OpenEdge. For information about setting up security questions, see Configuring security questions . For information about selecting and answering security questions, see Selecting and modifying your security questions .</body>
