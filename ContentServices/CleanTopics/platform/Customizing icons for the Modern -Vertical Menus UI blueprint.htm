    <body>If your application is configured to use the Modern - Vertical Menus UI blueprint, Platform renders the icons in the sidebar with the first letter of the name of the tab by default. If the sidebar is collapsed, the name of the tab is displayed when you hover the mouse over the icon. You can customize the tab icons in the following ways: Configure them to display two letters instead of one. For tabs with one word in their names, the icon contains the first two letters of the name. For tabs with more than one word in their names, the icon contains the first letter of the first two words. Configure an individual tab to use a font icon. You can select a font icon from Bootstrap Glyphicons or Font Awesome icons. Infinite Blue recommend Font Awesome icons, which are SVG icons that work well with resizing for different font size and work well with different themes.

You must set the value of this property in a custom sidebar script that executes before the UI starts, for example: &lt;script id="executeBeforeUIStarts"&gt; rb.newui.options.numOfCharsInTabDefaultIcon=2;
