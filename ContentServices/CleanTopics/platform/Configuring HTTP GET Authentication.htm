    <body>If you choose HTTP GET as your authentication method while Creating an Authentication Profile , specify values for the following fields to set up a Get call to authenticate to an external system. Default Setting: Selecting the Default UI or Default API fields indicate the authentication profile that is currently set as a default UI or default API authentication type. However, there is no compulsion that only one authentication profile should be the default for both the UI &amp; API authentications. Field Description Name Type an authentication profile name. Target URL URL that identifies the HTTP device and port (typically, http://device:port-number/...)) HTTP Headers Valid HTTP request headers to pass as part of the HTTP GET call. This is an optional field. Response Text Text that must be present in the HTTP response to indicate if the authentication was successful (for example, &lt;Authenticated&gt;true&lt;/Authenticated&gt; ). After specifying the above values, you must test your authentication method to check whether authentication succeeds. To test your authentication method: Under Test External Authentication, specify a valid login name and password. Click Test External Authentication. Note that you cannot save your changes until the test succeeds.</body>
