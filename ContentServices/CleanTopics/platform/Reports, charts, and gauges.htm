    <body>To provide data visualization for end-users, Platform offers the following features: Reports that you can create and configure in the following ways: Tabular: Each row represents a data record and each column represents a field. Tabular reports can include up to seven layers to show dependent records. Document template: You can build custom Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, plain text, and XML document templates that are used to display record data in pre-specified locations. HTML: You can create custom HTML documents that are used to display record data in pre-specified locations. JavaScript: You can write custom JavaScript code to loop over a list of records, perform calculations and analysis, and display results in custom HTML. Custom Reports: You can create custom report which is a specialized, business-specific report that meets the exact needs of your organization. Charts that present summaries of data in visual formats, such as bar charts, column charts, pie charts, donut charts, line graphs, and others. Charts can periodically and automatically refresh themselves without a complete page refresh. Some charts provide drill-down capabilities and interactivity options such as rotation and slice movement. Gauges that present a single formula-based value in a way similar to a car's speedometer or a scale display. Platform supports several different gauge types for various visual effects. Gauges can periodically and automatically refresh themselves without a complete page refresh. Writers: These procedures were tested and screen shots updated for 4.0, but we didn't have the time to re-write for usability. This should be done in a future release.</body>
