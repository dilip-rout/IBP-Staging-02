    <body>The Platform application includes a calendar. You can use the calendar to create meetings and other events, and to track tasks and their workflows. You can add the calendar to any application, and you can synchronize the Platform calendar with other calendar software. For example, meetings you add to the Platform calendar can appear in your Google calendar. The calendar displays records whose object definitions have an Event or a Task attribute, as well as records of the built-in objects Meeting and To-Do. Administrators can add the Calendar object to any application to include its built-in functionality. You can view the calendar by day, work week, week, month, or agenda. You can filter any calendar view by object type and by records assigned to you, to all users, to administrators, or to users with a specific role. Records marked as Private that are not assigned to you do not appear in your calendar. You access the calendar through the Platform application or any application that includes the Calendar object. You can use the Platform calendar functionality to: Create calendar events and tasks in any of the following ways: From the calendar itself: Double-click a day, select the type of entry to add, and click Create. From the Platform application: Add Meeting or To-Do records. From any application: Add a record for any object that includes the Task or Event attribute. As an administrator, add a Calendar component to any generic page using the page editor. For example, you might have object definitions for training classes, conferences, and project deadlines. Using a Calendar view, you can quickly see when you have any of these events planned and manage them accordingly. As an administrator, synchronize Platform calendar events (but not tasks) with Google calendar. See Synchronizing with Google Calendar for details. For other calendars, such as Microsoft Outlook, you can export records individually in the standard iCal format. Click the record you want to export and from the More Actions menu, select iCal. Platform exports the record locally and the Platform footer shows the exported file's name. Click the downloaded file to open it in Outlook and Outlook will prompt you to take the appropriate action.</body>
