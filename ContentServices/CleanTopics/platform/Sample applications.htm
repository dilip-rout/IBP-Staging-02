    <body>Another good way to become familiar with Platform is to install one or more ready-made starter applications from the Marketplace earlier known as the Application Directory. Note: Application Directory is only available for those Platform Private Cloud users whose master tenant administrator updated from a prior version to Platform 4.0 and did not enable Marketplace. Hosted Platform Marketplace contains only applications approved by Platform. The master administrator decides which applications will be available in it. Administrators can install any application from the Marketplace into their users' accounts with a single click. This enables them to immediately deploy critical business applications to the right people in the organization. Users can browse the Marketplace without being signed in. If they do not yet have a Platform account, they can sign up for a free trial from an application page and that application will be installed into their tenant automatically once it is created. For more information about installing and updating applications from Marketplace, see Using the Infinite Blue Platform Marketplace .</body>
