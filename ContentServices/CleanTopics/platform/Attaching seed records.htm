    <body>You can attach object records to your application as seed records. These records will be published and installed as part of the application. Once seed records are installed, they will not be updated during application updates. Seed records work best for testing and demonstration purposes. Because you attach records one at a time, this mechanism is not appropriate for distributing complete data sets. To attach seed records: From the application switcher drop-down available next to the application name: To navigate to settings for the current application, click App Settings. To navigate to settings for a different application, hover your mouse pointer over the application and click its associated Application Settings icon. Scroll down to the Seed Records section. Click Attach Records. The Record Selector window appears. Note: A maximum of 400 records can be attached. From the Attach Record drop-down list, select the type of object you want to attach. Click each record you want to add. You can select another type of object without closing the window. The records will be added to the application if they are not attached already. When you finish adding records, close the Record Selector window. The seed records will display. Note: If a System Settings object is attached to the application, an Attach Settings button will be available to add the settings as a seed record.</body>
