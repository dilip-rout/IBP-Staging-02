    <body>A Platform application XML file includes the definitions of all components associated with the application, such as objects, object menus, roles, hosted files, batch jobs and seed records. It is important to understand which components are included in an application when you publish it or generate an XML. Platform also enables you to republish your applications as you incrementally add new features or modify application functionality. Platform automatically increments the application version number each time you publish or generate an application XML.</body>
