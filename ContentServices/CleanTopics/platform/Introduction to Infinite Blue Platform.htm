    <body>Welcome to Infinite Blue® Platform, a web-based platform for creating, customizing and distributing applications. Platform applications run in an integrated online environment and share a common security model, data model and user interface. Platform allows you to focus on creating business value for users rather than on the expensive, complex and time-consuming tasks of managing software and infrastructure. The Platform development environment supports citizen developers and business users who want to create custom applications. Its framework of wizards and dialogs provide drag-and-drop and point-and-click convenience. You can create sophisticated applications without writing a line of code, but you also have the option to use standards such as JavaScript and HTML to customize the logic and user interface. To get started, you define a foundation for your app, by creating objects, their fields, and relationships between objects. From the app foundation, Platform generates a starter set of pages that end users interact with to view, create, update, and delete records. The following shows a few screens from an example application. The generated pages are highly customizable. Platform offers a flexible and mature environment, suitable for the most demanding applications: Platform options Platform offers both hosted and Private Cloud environments.
