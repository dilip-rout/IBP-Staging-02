    <body>You can set component-level permissions on an object, tab, menu, view, report, chart, or workflow action. The setup pages to view and edit these components include a Permissions section where you can click Edit Permissions to set permissions for different roles. You can also set these permissions on a role's Permissions page as described in Setting permissions by role . Setting permissions on a role's Permissions page allows you to see all views, reports, charts, and workflow actions associated with a particular object and all menus associated with a particular tab. This makes it easier to set a group of related permissions. On an object definition, you can set View, Create, Edit and Delete permissions. Users in a particular role will have the specified permissions for object records of that type: On a view or a chart, you can set a single View permission. A user's role (or the user) must have View permission on the associated object to be able to access the view or chart. Note: Limiting access to views can be useful for limiting user access to certain kinds of records, provided that the user is not permitted to create or edit views. However, we do not recommend this approach. Using relationship-based permissions or location, department, and function (LDF) based permissions is more secure and reliable. On a tab, menu, report, or workflow action component, you can set a single Access permission. A user's role (or the user) must have the appropriate permission(s) on the associated object(s) to be able to access a report or a workflow action.</body>
