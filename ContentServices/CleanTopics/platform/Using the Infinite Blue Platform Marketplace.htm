    <body>Infinite Blue Platform Marketplace is an online store where Platform users can buy and sell applications. The application offerings can be free or paid: Free applications: Publishers offer their applications free on the Marketplace. Users then directly install the applications from the Marketplace. Paid applications: Publishers offer their applications for a fee on the Marketplace. Users click Learn More to purchase and install the app from the publisher's Web page. The publisher hosts the application and manages billing and installation. See Installing an application from the Marketplace for information about installing applications from the Marketplace. The Marketplace works a bit differently for hosted and Private Cloud customer tenants: Hosted Platform users distribute their applications to the Marketplace hosted by Infinite Blue. This can be accessed by all Platform users. Platform Private Cloud master administrators can configure, manage, and rebrand a private Marketplace (one per Platform installation), and distribute their applications only to their users. See Managing the Marketplace using the Marketplace application in Platform Private Cloud for more information. Additionally, Platform Private Cloud master administrators who have moved from earlier versions of Platform to Platform 4.0 can choose to enable or disable Marketplace in their tenant. For more information, see Enabling or disabling Marketplace in Platform Private Cloud . The following diagram shows how users access the Marketplace: Those with access to the Marketplace can navigate to it in the following ways: By selecting the Install Applications option from the Platform menu. By selecting the New Application option from the Platform menu and clicking Install from Marketplace. From the Marketplace URL: Marketplace on Platform Private Cloud: http(s)://&lt;host-name&gt;/master/marketplace Note: You can configure your Platform Private Cloud Marketplace URL in Shared Properties .
