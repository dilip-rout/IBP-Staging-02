    <body>Where and how you install Platform depends on the architecture you have selected, whether you are require a single server or multi-server architecture, and which database(s) you plan to use. There are two ways to set up Platform: Use the Platform Private Cloud installer (for Windows or Linux operating systems) The installer gives you the option to install a Progress OpenEdge Database and PAS, a pre-configured version of Tomcat. If you don't use these, you must install a Web server and a database separately and configure them to work with Platform. The OpenEdge and PAS instances installed by the Platform installer are not set up as Windows services. To configure the installed PAS instance as a windows service or Linux daemon. You can use the installer in one of three modes: Default mode — A mode that uses a series of dialogs to guide you through the installation. Console mode — A mode that uses text-only prompts to guide you through the installation. Silent mode — A mode that enables the installer to run without any user interaction. Install Platform manually by extracting zip files The zip files provide flexibility for multi-server configurations and on operating systems on which the installer will not run. Manual installation with the zip files requires you to configure a web server and database separately and edit Platform configuration files. The first Platform instance you install and configure becomes the Master Sever. To use multiple Platform instances or auxiliary components, see Multi-server Edition . In a multi-server configuration, you will log in to the Master Server for administering your Private Cloud deployment. Note: Default installations of third party software often are configured to use minimum security. Please review vendor websites and documentation for recommended security configuration, such as changing default administrator passwords.</body>
