    <body>HTML event handlers are very useful for assisting in the creation or editing of Platform records. However, to fully use the power of HTML event handling, you might need to retrieve data from other Platform records or update other records from within custom client-side code. This can be achieved by using the Platform AJAX API. Any JavaScript on a Platform page can call these APIs as JavaScript functions. The Platform AJAX API uses the same access control rules as the Platform user interface and the SOAP API. A currently logged-in user must have valid permissions to view or edit the requested object record. See Client-side AJAX API for the available AJAX APIs. Infinite Blue is continually extending the list of available APIs. Using the AJAX API to make frequent calls to the production server can seriously slow the system, especially if many users are online simultaneously. To prevent that from happening Platform limits the total number of AJAX calls per user login session to 1000. Private Cloud customers can alter that limit.</body>
