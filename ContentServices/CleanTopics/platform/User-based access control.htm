    <body>You can set permissions for individual users on applications, components, and fields the same way you can set permissions for roles. If either a user or that user's role has permission to access something, that permission is granted to that user. For server-side APIs, the Server API role has all the admnistrative permissions by default. See Server-side API for more information. You set a user's permission the same way that you set permissions for a role: To view and set all permissions for a user, select Users from the Administrative Setup area of the Setup Home page. A user's Permissions page is similar to a role's Permissions page. See Setting permissions by role for more information. To set component-level permission for a user, in the Permissions table on the component's view page, click Select User, select the user from the list, and set the permissions. In the example below, the user Joe Recruiter is granted permission to view object records, even though that user's role, Officer, does not have that permission: There are also access control features that apply only to users: The Private attribute on events, tasks, reports, and templates The Record Creator role The following topics describe these features.</body>
