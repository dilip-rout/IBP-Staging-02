    <body>Before adding a database in Platform Private Cloud, you must first install it in a location accessible from the machine on which you will install Platform and then create Platform tables using the steps described in the Installation section under Databases . Additionally, you must ensure that your Web server library has the required JDBC driver. For example, for a PAS installed in the default location, it is the Progress\Rollbase\Pas_Instance\common\lib folder. Else the location is InfiniteBlue\Rollbase\apache-tomcat-x.x.x\rollbase\lib. To add a database in Platform Private Cloud, do the following: Log into the master tenant as an administrator. From the application switcher, select System Console. Locate the Databases list on the System tab and click Add. The Create Database screen appears: Specify the following database information: Database Name — A unique name that only contains alphanumeric characters Database Type — The type of database being created Platform supports OpenEdge, MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server. For Oracle and SQL Server, you can choose to use a DataDirect JDBC driver. Database URL — The database URL On selecting the Database Type field, this field presents you with an example URL. Substitute your host name and schema name in the URL, or if you are using a different driver, provide the URL to that driver. User Name and Password — The user name and password required for Platform to access the database Click Test Database Connection. If the test is successful, the Save button is enabled. Optionally, select: Use this database as default for new Customers to make this database as the default database for the newly created customer tenants. This database includes External tables which can be mapped as system objects if your database makes use of external tables that can be mapped to Platform Objects.. Specify the following connection pool options for this database: Pool Type — The type of JDBC connection pooling mechanism to implement for managing JDBC connections. You can implement connection pooling with Platform or Tomcat. Note: If you want to change the pool type for your database, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect. Min Connections — The minimum number of connections in the pool Max Connections — The maximum number of connections in the pool Max Time In Use — The maximum time (in minutes) allowed for the database connection to be in use. The connection is lost after the specified time has elapsed. Max Idle Time — The maximum time (in minutes) allowed for the database connection in a pool to be idle. The connection is lost after the specified time has elapsed. Max Life Time — The maximum connection lifetime before closure (in minutes) New Connection Timeout — The time allowed for a new database connection to be established. The connection is lost after the specified time, and you must retry connecting to your database. Transaction Isolation — The degree of locking that occurs when selecting data. Infinite Blue recommends that you consult your database manual to set this property. Use the Default option if you are unsure about this setting. Click Save. After saving the information you entered, the new database is displayed in the list. The node-config.json file is automatically updated on all the servers in your Private Cloud without a Web server restart. After creating and adding a database, you can click Edit to modify any database information. If you want to change the pool type for your database, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect. Note: If database replication is not setup, it is advised to disable binary logs in order to optimize disk space utilization.</body>
