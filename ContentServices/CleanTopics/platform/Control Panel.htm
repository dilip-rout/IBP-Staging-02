Currently, Custom, KerberosSAML/ADFS and Password authentication can be configured at the instance level. UI Authentication When configuring the instance-level authentication method, the authentication type can have valid values as Custom, SAML, Kerberos or Password. See Configuring SAML/ADFS Authentication and Configuring Kerberos Authentication , Configuring Password Authentication for all tenants for more information. API Authentication The authentication mechanism to user for login APIs. The value supported for this property depends on the authentication type: Password: Password, API Token, or Custom Enable Single User Multi Tenant This will allows the users to switch tenants.

The four available comparison values are - better, exact, maximum, and minimum. If no value is specified, it will default to minimum . See setAuthentication and getAuthentication for more information. Default: minimum Request Signature Method A signature method alogorithm to be used to sign the request being sent to the IDP. You can select RSA-SHA1 or RSA-SHA256. The default value is RSA-SHA1. Enable Just-In-Time for SAML When enabled, new application accounts are created on the fly by utilizing SAML assertions, thus eliminating manual account creations for every new user. With Just-In-Time enabled, the new user accounts are created dynamically by the first time users themselves upon the SAML based Platform SSO portal. See Just-in-Time Provisioning , for more information. Validate User Fields on creation If enabled, field format, mandatory fields and unique fields are validated on record creation for all the user fields including the below mentioned mandatory fields.
