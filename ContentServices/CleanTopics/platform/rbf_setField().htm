    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function sets the value of specified field for a selected Platform record and modifies the actual record value without changing the UI presentation. Compare with rbf_setFieldValue() API which sets UI presentation but does not immediately change backend value. If an error occurred during update operation, an error notification procedure will be invoked . For fields that allow values in multiple languages, use the fieldValue parameter to set values for additional languages. If there is not already a value in a field for the tenant's base language, it is mandatory to supply a value for the base language. The current user must have Edit permission on the selected object type to run this API. Syntax rbf_setField(objName, id, fieldName, fieldValue, useIds, callback, useLegacyDateFormat) Parameters objName The integration name of the selected Object definition id ID of the selected object record fieldName The name of the field for which the value will be set fieldValue The new value for the field. For fields that support multiple languages, the value of this parameter is a JSON object that specifies the two-letter ISO language code and value for each language, for example: {":en":"EnglishValue","el":"GreekValue"} useIds If true, the API will accept numeric IDs; if false (default) the API will return integration codes for status fields and picklists callback A function to be executed when the operation is successful. It does not receive any parameters. This is an optional parameter. useLegacyDateFormat This optional parameter only applies to JSON output and, specifically, to Date and Date/Time fields. If true , or if not specified, a date value is returned as a Date object. If false , a date value is returned as a String. Note: This API is supported in portals as well.</body>
