    <body>To protect Platform resources from overuse, the number of API calls is limited. The system calculates the number of API calls (excluding login and logout calls) in 60-minute periods. If the number of calls during the current period exceeds the maximum limit, no new calls are allowed until the current period ends and a new counter starts. The actual number of API hits allowed is determined by your subscription. You can find this information in the Subscription Details page. Contact Infinite Blue Platform Support if you need to increase this limit for any reason.</body>
