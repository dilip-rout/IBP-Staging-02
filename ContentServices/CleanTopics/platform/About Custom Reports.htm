    <body>A custom report is a specialized, business-specific report that you create to meet the exact needs of your organization. This Platform enables you to create custom reports using the Report Builder capability and customize the report templates based on a combination of criteria. Key Features Create a custom report across multiple related objects WYSIWYG Report builder for designing custom report Flexible options to add a variety of sections to your report Automate reusable sections/sub-sections of a custom report using the Loop feature Multiple formatting options for the report content - both pre-defined and custom Choose to export the custom report output as a HTML or PDF Types of Custom Reports You can create the following types of custom reports based on your business need: Record Specific Custom Report: A record specific custom report is designed to execute against a specfic or selected record for a defined object. All Records Custom Report: This type of custom report is designed to execute against all records of a defined object. Note: You will be able to view custom reports created prior to the Platform 5.1 Limitations Previously created custom reports can be edited and saved as a new enhanced custom report. However, the application cannot be imported into a Platform version less than 5.1 As a best practice: Recreate filters with date intervals to enhance the existing custom reports. Recreate the loops as the design of the reports have been enhanced. Filters cannot be applied on doc template, email template, formula, integration link, and password fields. An HTML output can use all HTML and CSS constructs that browsers support, but a PDF output is limited to PD4ML capabilities. Refer this specification http://pd4ml.com/css.htm to learn more.

A custom report that groups "All Leads records by status" is an example of All records custom reports.</body>
