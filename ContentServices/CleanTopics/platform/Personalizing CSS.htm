    <body>Platform provides the following features that make it easier to customize image and JSP files for white labeling: Customizing image files — The Platform installation directory now contains a folder, &lt;rollbase_install_dir&gt;\pas\rollbase\personalize\images, where you can place image files that override standard Platform image files. Any files in this folder will be used instead of the standard images. To replace standard images, copy the image file you want to use into the above directory. The following image files can be overridden: Images in the application switcher from setup pages and on the Applications Setup &gt; Applications page: web-app-this.png — For desktop browsers, the icon next to the Platform application (application switcher only) web-app.png — For desktop browsers, the icon next to other applications (all applications on the Applications Setup &gt; Applications page) mobil-app-this.png — For mobile browsers, the icon next to the Platform application (application switcher only) mobil-app.png — For mobile browsers, the icon next to other applications (all applications on the Applications Setup &gt; Applications page) Images on the Getting Started with Infinite Blue Platform page: 1icon.png — The icon next to Create New Apps 2icon.png — The icon next to Customize Your Apps 3icon.png — The icon next to Share Your Apps Images in setup page headers: pacific-logo.svgz — The Pacific logo setupLogo.svgz — The Setup logo Images in application page headers: Progress.png — The logo for light themes ProgressBlackBg.png — The logo for dark themes Images on portal and account settings pages: Poweredby.gif — The Powered by Infinite Blue logo Customizing JSP files — References to obfuscated classes have been removed from the following JSP files, making the migration of customizations easier. Now, when there are no changes to the original JSP file in a new release, you can replace it with your customized file from the previous release. Any changes to these files will be documented for each subsequent release, so you will know whether the files you have customized need to be changed. All directories are relative to &lt;rollbase_install_dir&gt;\Pas_Instance\webapps (if using PAS) or &lt;tomcat-install-dir&gt;\webapps (if using Tomcat). router\login\loginPrivate.jsp — The custom login page router\login\logout.jsp — The custom logout page router\login\forgotPassword.jsp and router\login\forgotPassword2.jsp - The custom forgot password page router\login\mobile.jsp — The custom mobile login page master(or prod1)\components\logout.jsp — The custom logout animation page. master(or prod1)\components\loginExpired.jsp — The custom login expired page Note: Customers who customized portaltheme.css and rbtheme.css files accessible from &lt;WebSiteHTTP(s)&gt;/css will now have to place the customized files under the &lt;ROLLBASE_HOME&gt;/personalize/css folder.</body>
