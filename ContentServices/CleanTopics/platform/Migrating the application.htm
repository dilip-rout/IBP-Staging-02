    <body>Platform uses Web service APIs to extract information from your Salesforce.com or Force.com account. The migration process builds a new Platform application that contains all of your data. Before attempting migration, ensure that your organization has access to Salesforce.com APIs. Before creating the new application in Platform, log in to your Salesforce or Force account and select the application you want to migrate (for example, if you want to migrate your Salesforce.com CRM application, be sure to select the "Sales" application). Platform migrates the currently active application. Do one of the following: From an application page: Select New Application from the Platform menu. From a setup page: Click New Application on the sidebar. The Create a New Application dialog opens. Select Create from External Data. The Import Application Metadata page opens. Select Salesforce.com (Force.com) and click Next. Provide your Salesforce.com credentials (Platform will not store or reuse your Salesforce.com credentials. They are only used once to temporarily retrieve your data): User name (with sufficient permissions to access Web API) Password Security token To retrieve your Salesforce.com API security token, login to your Salesforce.com account and click Setup &gt; My Personal Information &gt; Reset Security Token. Platform retrieves the following metadata from your most recently accessed Salesforce.com application: Object menus (Web and system menus cannot be extracted because Force.com does not expose them as metadata). Custom objects and most standard objects, including their components: Field definitions (including formula fields) Relationships Page layout definitions (which are converted into Platform pages) Use the check boxes to identify the objects, fields, and relationships you want to import from Salesforce.com into your new Platform application. Note: If a Salesforce object already exists in your tenant, the migration tool will not attempt to import any components. Click Create to complete the migration. After automatically creating and configuring your new application, Platform will proceed to import the actual data from your Salesforce.com account (providing that you've selected this option). The data import is done asynchronously and you will receive an email with import results when the process is completed. Each call to Salesforce API brings back up to 500 records of a particular type. Notice that all of your object definitions, fields, relationships, and data migrated and the exact layout of all of your application pages is maintained in your new Platform application. At this point you can start working with your new application just like any other Platform app, by adding data, editing objects, pages, etc.</body>
