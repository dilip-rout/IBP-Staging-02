    <body>With latest features and enhancements to platform development capabilities, Platform 5.3 offers the advantage of vastly improving the user experience of a citizen developer. Here’s a quick overview of the enhanced features and documentation in the Platform 5.3 1. Enhanced Loop Section in Custom reports The drag-n-drop user interface of the Loop Section in Custom reports empowers the citizen developers to quickly and easily design multi-layered custom reports without the need to code. The drag-n-drop user interface comprises predefined data rendering patterns such as Table, Bullet and Number list. You can easily configure the loop section with any object or related object field(s) to design complex, multi-layered custom reports. For detailed information of this feature, refer Custom Reports . 2. Record Validation on Multi-tabbed pages Validation errors are highlighted for tabs with an error icon and is brought into focus automatically. This enables the end users to identify which field(s) on a multi-tabbed page has error(s). For detailed information of this feature, refer Record Validation . 3. Related Object support for Expression Fields The expression fields now aid an automatic evaluation of the field value on any related-object field update. This triggers the expression field update on selecting the related-object fields as configured by the admin. This offers a better command over the expression fields. Apart from the automatic evaluation, an admin can also force-update the expression field value from the field definition page. The expression fields are now in feature parity with formula fields. Hence, they can also be converted into formula fields and vice-versa. Expression fields can also be used in the View Filters and Color Code View. For detailed information of this feature, refer Expression Field . 4. SFTP Support for Batch jobs With the new Secure FTP support, you can highly secure the file transfers by configuring batch jobs. While defining, you can also configure the batch jobs by providing the SFTP server location with credentials. Platform currently supports the following types of batch jobs with SFTP configuration: FTP Data Snapshot Scheduled FTP Import 5. Introducing new APIs for Date and Date/Time Fields The newly introduced APIs can get the Date and Date/Time field values in specific (ISO or User) formats.
