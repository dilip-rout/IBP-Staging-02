    <body>Purpose This property allows you to specify whether to show or hide the advanced filter options component in the filter interface. Setting it to true shows the component. Note: This property applies to the new UI, not the classic UI. Most Platform tenants are using the new UI. However, tenants on older Private Cloud installations might still be using the classic UI. This property is not supported in portals. Setting it to false hides the component. The screen below shows the advanced filter option component and the Boolean operator component in the filter interface: When used in conjunction with showBooleanOperators , and both are set to false, the entire row in which they appear is hidden, saving vertical space on the screen: Note: You must set this property's value in a custom sidebar script that executes before the UI starts. See Executing a script before the UI starts for details. Fully qualified name rb.newui.options.filters.showAdvancedFilterTypes Example The following code hides the advanced filter options component. &lt;script id="executeBeforeUIStarts"&gt; rb.newui.options.filters.showAdvancedFilterTypes = false; &lt;/script&gt;</body>
