    <body>Use password authentication by creating a User record for each account. When you create a User record, Platform generates a temporary password and sends it to the user's email account (by default, an email with Welcome to Infinite Blue Platform as its subject). On the first log in, the Platform user is requested to change the password against the temporary password. There is no field or template token corresponding to user's password because Platform does not store actual users' passwords, but stores an encrypted (salted and hashed) password instead. The Welcome to Infinite Blue Platform email is based on a template included in the default Platform application and you can modify it for your requirements. This template is named Welcome to Infinite Blue Platform and is associated with the User object. See Email templates for more information. If a user is allowed to change the password for either the authentication profile (UI or API), the Change Password page will be visible. This page allows password change for both UI and API authentication profiles. If only one profile exists for which password could be changed, the tabs will not be present and only the options for that profile will displayed on the UI. When you use password authentication, Platform Private Cloud lets you configure the following user authentication features: Security level - Controls login session behavior and password requirements. Password expiration policy - Specifies the number of days until a user password expires. Password expiration email notifications - Specifies when Platform sends password expiration email messages to users. Custom validation formulas - Configures your specific security policy. Security questions for authentication - Requires users to answer security questions.</body>
