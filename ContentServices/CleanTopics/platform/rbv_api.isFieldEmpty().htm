    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This Object Script method checks whether value of particular field is null or empty without bringing the actual value into the formula. Note: Because isFieldEmpty() acts on existing data, it cannot be used in a validation script, which checks data before storing it. Formulas used in Object Script triggers can include other API methods and regular Platform template functionality, such as loops. Object Script methods have no effect if called outside of update triggers. Syntax rbv_api.isFieldEmpty(objName, Id, fieldName) Parameters objName Integration name of object Id ID of record fieldName Integration name of file upload field to retrieve value from Return value true if value of a field from an existing object record is null or empty, false otherwise Example if (rbv_api.isFieldEmpty("order", {!id}, "description") { do something }</body>
