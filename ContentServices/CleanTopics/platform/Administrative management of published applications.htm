    <body>Platform Administrators can manage published applications from the Master Server (see Administration ). The Published Apps tab in the System Console provides controls for updating, deleting, and performing other actions on published applications. Because the published application object is itself a Platform object, Platform Master Server administrators can define a custom approval process for allowing published applications to appear in the Application Directory. By default, this is simply done by checking the Approved checkbox field. Platform Master Server administrators can also push new versions of an application to customers who have previously installed that application. See Pushing application updates to other tenants .</body>
