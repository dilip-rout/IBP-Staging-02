    <body>When you create applications or add new object definitions to existing applications, Platform creates a set of application pages for each of the objects you define. By default, Platform creates a page containing a list view of all records for each object. The page also contains controls for creating, searching, viewing, editing, and deleting object records. Page components are different depending on the type of device, which can be a desktop, tablet, or smart phone. They are also different depending on the UI blueprint used. Each UI blueprint renders the page components in a different way. The following topics describe how page components are rendered in each UI blueprint. Application pages contain the following components: The Platform Menu and Help The application tab and menu bar (Traditional UI blueprint only) The Application Switcher (Modern - Vertical Menus UI blueprint only) The Page Options menu (desktop only) The customer logo (desktop only) The search button (desktop and tablet only) Application pages that display list views also have a page menu (desktop only). See Application page types for a list of application page types.</body>
