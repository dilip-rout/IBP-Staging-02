    <body>You can delete any field except for system fields created automatically by Platform. Fields created by Platform when you enable object attributes and relationships will be deleted automatically if you remove the attribute or delete the relationship. For fields you delete manually, when you confirm deletion, the system will: Delete the field definition from the object definition. Delete all of that field's data for all existing records. Remove the field from all pages, views and reports. The system will not modify formulas, templates, integration links and API calls containing a reference to the deleted field. It is your responsibility as the application developer to ensure that a deleted field is no longer used in these components.</body>
