    <body>With the Phone Number field type, users can enter a phone number along with it's country code. The following properties can be defined while creating an Phone Number field: Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Default Size — The default size of the input field shown in forms (you can override this default as a page-level property using the page editor). Country Codes — While adding the phone number field from the object definition, to prefix country code to a phone number, the Country Codes option is checked by default. If unchecked, the country code selection drop down will not be displayed for this phone number field. While adding/updating a record with a phone number field, the user can perform a search using any Country Name or Country Code from the corresponding drop down. Input Mask — The phone number field is by default formatted to an input mask as ########## (10 hashes - where the user can increase or decrease the number of hashes). The input mask applied during input is displayed on all pages. The input mask can include: The # symbol for numeric character The * symbol for any input character Letters and separators Advanced Field Properties — For more information, see Advanced field properties . Integration Name — The integration name is used to reference this field via merge fields or with Platform APIs. Field-Level Help — The Field-Level Help box allows you to define help text for the field that will appear in a popup when the user clicks the help icon next to the field. The phone number field is by default formatted to an input mask as ########## (10 hashes - where the user can increase or decrease the number of hashes). The input mask applied during input is displayed on all pages. The input mask can include: The # symbol for numeric character The * symbol for any input character Letters and separators Note: Platform also provides the Click to Call feature for Platform applications on your desktop and mobile devices. Any phone number will automatically appear as a clickable link enabling users to quick dial the number from the UI. Once the phone number field is created with Country Codes option enabled, it cannot be disabled. Similarly if the phone number field is created with Country Codes option disabled, it cannot be enabled later. Therefore, the phone number fields created prior to version 5.10.1, do not support the country code functionality. Phone Number fields with Country Codes option enabled are not supported in Portals. No validations are performed on the Phone number fields while importing records. The phone number fields are validated if edited manually.</body>
