    <body>The application menu bar contains tabs. Each tab can have child menu items. For example, in the screens below, Titles, Check Outs, and Check Ins are tabs that Platform created when the objects were created. Available Titles is a child menu that was added to the Titles tab. The following screen shows the tabs in the Traditional UI blueprint: The following screen shows the tabs in the Modern - Vertical Menus UI blueprint: Menus are child components of tabs. You can modify a tab to change it into a menu of another tab and you can promote a menu to be a tab. You can create tabs of any of the following types: Generic tab — Associated with pages that contain custom content such as arbitrary views, charts, HTML or script components, or third party widgets. Object tab — By default, when you create an object, Platform creates an object tab for the records list page, which lists all records of that object type. Controls and tab menu items on this page allow the user to navigate to other pages for the same object, such as the new and view pages. See Application page types for more information about the pages Platform creates for objects. Web tab — Contains an embedded website and allows you to embed other sites or web-based applications into your Platform applications. See Creating tabs and pages for more information. You can edit application tabs to add and reorder menus and set permissions that determine which menu items will be visible to users. You can organize navigation by creating new menus, removing menu items, or changing tabs to be child menus of other tabs (tabs that are assigned a parent become menus of the parent). For more information about editing tabs and menus, see Customizing application tabs and menus .</body>
