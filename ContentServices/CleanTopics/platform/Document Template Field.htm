    <body>A Document Template Field type is a picklist that allows users to assign a document template to use for a specific Object record. You can assign a default value to this Field and have it assigned to all existing records. This Field renders a link to generate a document on the fly based on the selected document template using the record's data. You can also use it in combination with a Create Template Document Trigger, see Trigger overview . When used as token in email templates, the Document Template Field will generate an email attachment with the file generated from the document template for the current record. Tip: Use Fields of this type when you want to allow users to select different types of document templates for different Object records. For example, you may allow your sales users to select a different Quote Template based on the type of order being created. Used with a Create Template Document trigger, you can automate the creation of the appropriate type of document on an as-needed basis. In View mode Document Template presents a link. When clicked, this link opens parsed document template (populated with record's data) in pop-up window. You can specify size of that window in pixels (650 x 600 by default). For HTML templates only you can choose to render them as PDF rather than HTML.</body>
