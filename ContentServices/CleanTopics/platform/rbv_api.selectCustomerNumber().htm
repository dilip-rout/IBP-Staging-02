    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose Same as selectNumber(), but is called from the master server and runs on the customer tenant with the specified ID. Note: When used in a trigger on a customer object with "After Create" timing, this API should be made to run as a delayed trigger Syntax rbv_api.selectCustomerNumber (custId, query, arg1, arg2…) Parameters custId ID of the customer record to query query SQL SELECT query. See an example below and see Query API for examples and limitations. args Variable number of parameters passed to query (optional) Return value Query result as a number Permissions required The current user must be logged into the master server. Unless this API is being used in delayed triggers or scheduled batch jobs, the current user must have either administrative permissions or View permission on the Customer object and the selected object type. See Managing customer tenants for more information about customer tenants and the master server. Example This example fetches number of records from a User object for a customer with the ID represented by the {!id} token: var count = rbv_api.selectCustomerNumber({!id}, "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM USER");</body>
