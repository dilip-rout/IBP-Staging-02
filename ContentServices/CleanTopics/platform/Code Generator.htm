    <body>To access Platform APIs from external computer systems, customers often need to write computer code that uses Object names, Field names, and some other customer-specific parameters. Writing such code can be a tedious and error-prone task, since it might require many copy-and-paste operations. To simplify this task, Platform provides a Code Generator, available from the Application Setup page. The Code Generator parses and fetches a text template that uses the metadata tokens described below. Template Token Description {!#SYSTEM_NAME} Name of the Platform installation {!#HOST_NAME} Host name used by the Platform installation {!#CURR_CUSTM.name} Customer name {!#CURR_CUSTM.id} Customer ID {!#CLASS_NAME} Class name (free text input from the Code Generator page) {!#OBJ_LOOP_BEGIN} Marks the beginning of a loop through selected Objects. Text within the loop is replicated for each selected Object. {!#OBJ_LOOP_END} Marks the end of an Object loop. {!#object.name} Integration name of an Object in a loop. {!#object.display} Display name of an Object in a loop. {!#FIELD_LOOP_BEGIN} Marks the beginning of loop through fields of the current Object. Text within the loop is replicated for each field (excluding read-only fields). {!#FIELD_LOOP_END} Marks the end of a Fields loop. {!#field.name} Integration name of a Field in a loop. {!#field.display} Display name of a Field in a loop.</body>
