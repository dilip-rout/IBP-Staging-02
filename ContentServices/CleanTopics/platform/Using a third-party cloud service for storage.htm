    <body>By default, for ISV and Private Cloud users, Platform backs up data on a local drive. You can configure the backup location from the System Console. The Storage server component specifies the backup location value. You can set the data backup limit per backup by specifying a value for the storageUsageLimitForBkp property in the Shared Properties. For more information on Shared Properties, see Shared Properties . As an alternative to local storage, you (an ISV or a Private Cloud user) can purchase and enable a third-party cloud storage (Amazon S3, S3 Compatible Storage, or Microsoft Azure) for your customer tenants. Cloud storage is used on a tenant by tenant basis. Note: Using a third party cloud service for storage can impact performance because files and images are not served directly by Platform but from that third party. Infinite Blue recommends that you test the performance of your selected storage provider before deploying cloud storage in production scenarios. After you have enabled cloud storage, the files will be moved to your storage account in an asynchronous mode. The tenant administrator will receive an email with summary of the moved files. After that, you can delete the local files to save disk space. All errors related to third-party cloud services are logged in the storage.log file. Please review this file if you're having problems with remote storage. See the following topics for more information:</body>
