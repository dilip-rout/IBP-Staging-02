    <body>Objects, their fields, and the relationships between them form the data model for a Platform application. From these, Platform generates a set of pages for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting records. The topics in this section describe how to work with applications, objects, and records. You can create a Platform app in different ways, depending on your requirements: If you are starting from scratch and have an initial set of objects in mind, use the Quick Create wizard. The Quick Create wizard walks you through a series of steps to create an application and an initial set of objects. You can also specify relationships between the objects. The Quick Create wizard does not support all advanced field and attribute types, but you can easily edit the application and objects later to add them. See Getting started with the Quick Create wizard and Editing applications for more information. If you want to use objects that already exist in your tenant, create the application first as described in Creating an application your way , and edit it to add the objects, as described in Editing applications . It you want to import applications, import data from an existing data source or create external objects that map to other data sources, see Integrating with outside sources The following videos provide a quick orientation to Platform: A tour of the Platform interface A demo of how to use the Quick Create Wizard A demo of how to add business logic A demo of how to customize the user experience An overview of how to distribute your applications to end-users or sell them The topics in this section describe how to create and manage applications and objects.</body>
