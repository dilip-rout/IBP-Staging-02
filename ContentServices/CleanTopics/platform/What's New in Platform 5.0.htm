    <body>This topic describes the list of new features and enhancements as part of Platform 5.0 With a set of new and improved enterprise business features, Platform strives to continually delight its customers. The Platform 5.0 release revolves around empowering users with high availability, auto scalability, greater effectiveness and simpler, more intuitive UI. All of these enhancements and features work together to promote greater efficiency. Visual Workflow Designer The Visual Workflow Designer provides a powerful drag-and-drop interface that enables you to visually build your workflow processes to achieve better work outcomes. The new intuitive interface adds greater clarity around how you want to map your process steps using statuses, actions and triggers through visual representation like a flowchart and allows you to define your workflow processes with ease. The new Visual Workflow Designer is fully compatible with workflows from prior Platform releases. So, you can continue to manage all your existing workflows as usual and design them in the new Visual Workflow designer. See Working with the Workflow Designer for more information. Cluster Manager for High Availability and Auto Scalability With its Active-Active High-Availability, Platform 5.0 now offers your business applications maximum uptime and better fault tolerance in a cost-effective manner. All Platform components can now be configured for high availability to manage your server usage on AWS in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Platform 5.0 also enables your business applications to respond to varying load requirements by configuring your own rules and policies through the use of tools like Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling. You can automate the infrastructure to ensure that risks related to potential loss of readership, sales, or the attrition of customers are mitigated with servers that can be spun up as network traffic increases and scaled down when traffic decreases. See Configuring High Availability for more information. Platform System Console Platform offers an enhanced System Console dashboard. From there, you can easily view, configure and manage all the Platform system components, servers, databases, customer load, shared properties, control panel and monitoring jobs. This does away with the hassle of working in the backend to perform tasks such as manual configuration of shared properties and waiting for system restart. With the System Console dashboard, tedious tasks like system configuration and load balancing become a swift and easy experience. See System Tab Interface for more information. Dynamic Request Routing with Nginx With bigger sites, you will need multiple Node instances to scale quickly and manage greater volumes of traffic. To effectively handle your traffic, Platform allows you to configure Nginx. Nginx decides where to route a request with Active/Active clustering, supporting greater throughput without a single point of failure and maintains isolation of tenant cache. Nginx follows an asynchronous event-driven model for handling requests. When configuring Nginx in the private cloud, update the default Nginx pages such as index.html, 404.html, 50x.html (for all 500 series error codes) and favicon. Platform ships these pages under the …/nginx/html folder. See Configuring Nginx for more information. Distributed Cache to Support Seamless Horizontal Scalability &amp; Resiliency With distributed cache, Platform has seamless horizontal scalability and resiliency and to serve one customer from multiple nodes and enables in-memory access to frequently used data as it pools resources from several servers. This provides the benefit of all nodes sharing the load of responding to requests while limiting the interruption to routine Platform operations during optimization and maintenance activities. In turn, this helps increase performance with minimal disruption. Improved Job Resiliency Platform supports job resiliency so that all background operations for your business applications are executed seamlessly regardless of node failures or other external error conditions. Platform supports the below job pools for resiliency: Delayed Trigger jobs Batch jobs Import jobs Large jobs Mail jobs See Components (Running Jobs section) for more information. Highly Available Search Large-scale, online production systems need to be highly available without downtime despite any issues that may be encountered. Platform ensures that the search re-indexing jobs of such systems are not lost, or processed twice and are not prone to corruption in the event of failure or problematic issues. Enhanced Auto-number The Auto-number field behavior has been enhanced to provide consistent user experience across UI and API for better ease of use. We have also enhanced the Auto-number functionality to be better managed for change in the auto number sequence, concurrency and bulk operation through API or Import Jobs. See Auto-number Functional Changes for more information. Client-side REST API Invocation This feature introduces a powerful client side AJAX API rbf_sendHttpRequest in the Platform platform to enhance customization capability of Platform application. This AJAX API enables developers to invoke REST APIs from Platform Pages and Portal pages using custom script components. UI Enhancements With Platform 5.0, we focused on improving usability and the end user experience through new app configurations that enhance different UI elements. Configuring UI Blueprint for Desktop and Mobile: Platform 5.0 enables you to offer distinct experiences to users based on the type of device used to access the application. This is done by managing application level configuration to define different Blueprints for mobile and desktop. Click to Call: Platform now provides the Click to Call feature for Platform applications on your desktop and mobile devices. Any phone number will automatically appear as a clickable link enabling users to quick dial the number from the UI. Enhanced Configurable Positioning of Notifications: You can now better configure Platform notification messages to appear based on the context of your application. With Platform 5.0 notification messages can be set to display at the center, top corner or bottom corner. Mobile-friendly Grid Control: The new Platform grid control provides visual consistency between layouts. It also enables you to configure as per application requirements, which improves the experience for mobile users. The new responsive grid control provides larger clickable areas that enable you to collapse or expand each row inside individually. CDN Support To augment the transport network and improve the performance and scalability of various deployments, Platform provides Content Delivery Network (CDN) support. CDN support provides the following benefits: Improved client-side performance and faster page loading by caching static files Increased server -side scalability by serving static files from Tomcat/Nginx See CDN Support for more information. HTTP/FTP Request Retry Platform provides support for applications to handle transient failures by retrying failed operations. This can improve the stability of the application. To achieve this, Platform has added retry parameters for HTTP trigger types and FTP batch jobs by enabling and configuring status codes, number of retries and retry interval parameters. See HTTP Triggers for more information. Improved Client-side Performance Platform 5.0 delivers key performance enhancements to UI, business layer and data layer interaction, which improves the chart rendering performance through better use of cache and limiting unnecessary database queries. This will also improve the performance of ListView, lookup fields and grid controls.</body>
