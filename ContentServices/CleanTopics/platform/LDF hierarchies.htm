    <body>The Organization Management application includes Location, Department, and Function objects, and is pre-populated with a set of base records. Each set of records is organized in a hierarchy. For example, a portion of the location hierarchy is pre-populated with the following: You can add, edit, and delete records in the hierarchy according to your requirements. For LDF permissions, if a group has permission to access a location, department, or function, it also has permission to access its children. For example, in the above graphic, if a group has permission to access records with the location United States, it also has permission to access records with the locations Chicago, IL, Houston, TX, and the rest of the child locations.</body>
