    <body>If you cannot send emails from your Platform Private Cloud instance, check the following: Make sure that all email-related global settings in the Shared Properties are correct. If you are behind a firewall (corporate or local), verify that the firewall allows outgoing SMTP connections. If you are using Gmail, verify that POP/IMAP Access is enabled in your Gmail settings. If you still cannot successfully send emails, add a SkipEmails=true setting temporarily. This will dump all emails to standard output (the console window of Tomcat log file). This also allows you to recover the reset password link for new users.</body>
