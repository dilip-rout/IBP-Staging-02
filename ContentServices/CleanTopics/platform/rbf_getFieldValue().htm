    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function retrieves the value of a field on current page with a given integration name. It will return null if the field does not exist or is not included on the current page. For fields that contain values for different languages, pass a langCode value in the options parameter to get the value in a specific language. To retrieve the value in the tenant's base language, do not use the options parameter. Syntax rbf_getFieldValue(fieldName, options) Parameters fieldName The field integration name. options An optional JSON object that sets the values of optional arguments. Currently this is only used for setting langCode to a valid two-letter ISO language code, for example, {"langCode":"es"}. Note: This API is supported in portals as well. Example The following example returns the Spanish value of the field with the integration name name. rbf_getFieldValue("name",{"langCode":"es"});</body>
