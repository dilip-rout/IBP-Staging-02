    <body>On hosted Platform, the first person to sign up from a particular organization becomes an administrator of the Platform tenant. (A tenant is a virtual space for creating and managing apps.) On Platform Private Cloud, the person whose email address is entered during installation becomes the first administrator of the Private Cloud tenant(s). Administrators can create user accounts, install applications from the Application Directory, customize applications for specific business needs, and create applications. Administrators create user accounts by adding User records. Each User record has a required User Role field. Any Platform user with the Administrator role has complete administrative privileges. See Role-based access control for information about roles. Private Cloud and ISV Partners have the option create multiple tenants, which they do by adding Customer records. Therefore, the documentation often refers to these as customer tenants. Typically, those with the ability to create tenants will want to use separate tenants for development and production. See Managing customer tenants for more information.</body>
