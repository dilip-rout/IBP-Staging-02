    <body>The topics in this section describe Platform configuration files. The source of these files should be in the config folder of the Master Server instance. When Platform starts, it saves these files, including the license, in the database so the configuration is applied across all instances. You can edit many settings through the UI. Those changes will be saved in the database and in the configuration files. If you change a setting by manually editing a configuration file, you need to restart the PAS or Tomcat instance that is hosting the Master Server.</body>
