    <body>Introduction Platform’s current UI (built on Kendo) provides theme support with certain pre-defined themes; for example, Office 365, Nova, Material, Metro, etc. These themes were provided by Kendo and Platform has applied several customizations to the same. Theme support is enabled in the Sapphire UI (built on React), and the themes are provided by Ant Design. The Sapphire UI also provides a theme builder for managing themes at the customer-level. Note: Themes defined in one customer would not be accessible to other customers. Ant Design Themes Ant Design is a popular React UI framework, providing enterprise UI. It has an excellent theme support. Ant Design uses LESS as the development technology to provide stylings. A list of LESS variables can be found here . Ant Design supports following official themes: Default Theme Dark Theme Compact Theme Aliyun Console Theme (Beta) Note: These system-provided themes cannot be modified or deleted by the user. Theme builder also supports the creation, modification, and deletion of custom themes. Theme Builder Platform Sapphire UI provides a theme builder for Admin users, using which admins can manage custom themes. To access the theme builder: Click Theme Management on the side navigation menu. You can select one of the 4 official themes that appear in the Theme drop-down list. Theme builder provides a color palette to select colors, along with text boxes. For instance, @info-color under Colors can be given a value such as @primary-color and @processing-color can be given value such as @blue-6. It displays the customizations group by type. Official themes cannot be modified or deleted by the user. However, the user can preview theme settings such as colors in the Default theme, and then save the theme as a new custom theme by clicking Save As in the drop-down list as shown in the image below. Modifications can also be made to a custom theme by clicking Save after modifying it. If the user wishes to reset a modified theme to its original configurations, then Reset must be clicked at the bottom. Custom themes can be deleted by clicking the Delete button for that particular theme in the Theme drop-down list. Once a theme is saved, it gets added to the Themes drop-down list. It is to be noted that the theme builder also supports modifying already created custom themes. Note:You can also preview and change the 4 system provided themes as well as custom themes, by clicking My Theme on the left navigation bar, and selecting a theme from the drop down list at the top as displayed in the image below. You can select themes to preview them, and then click Apply to finalize a theme. If two different themes have been set at the application level and the user level, then the user level theme is considered as the principal theme.
