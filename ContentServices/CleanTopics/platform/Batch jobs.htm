    <body>Platform batch jobs (similar to Oracle Cron jobs) can be used to schedule periodic system maintenance, notification, and integration tasks. Batch jobs use the permissions set on each object for the Query API. To create a new batch job: From the application switcher, select Setup Home &gt; Administration Setup&gt; Batch Jobs. Click New Batch Job. Select one of the following options and select Next: System Backup: This job generates a system backup file. Optionally, it can upload the backup file to a remote FTP server. FTP retry feature will be enabled for this batch job if you select the System Backup Properties &gt; Upload Backup File To FTP option. File Storage Description Type Backup Batch Job will push backup file to the storage option that you select. You can select FTP/Amazon S3/Microsoft Azure/S3 Compatible Storage. FTP If you have chosen FTP , you are required to enter Encryption, FTP Host Name, User Name, Password, Disable Passive Mode, and Remote Directory. Amazon S3 If you have chosen Amazon S3, you are required to enter the S3 ID, S3 Key, S3 Path, and S3 Bucket.

FTP Data Snapshot: This job takes a snapshot of report data and uploads it via FTP/SFTP to a remote server in CSV, XLS, XLSX or XML format. By default, this batch job has FTP/SFTP retry feature enabled. Re-index Search Data: This job re-creates the index used for global text search. Scheduled FTP Import: This job uploads spreadsheet file from a remote FTP/SFTP server and starts the import process defined in the selected import map. By default, this batch job has FTP/SFTP retry feature enabled. Note: FTP/SFTP retry will be initiated only when one of the the following exceptions or failures occur — connection to host failed, login failed, uploading file failure, downloading file failure, deleting file failure, and changing directory failure. By default, the number of FTP/SFTP retries allowed is 5. The default value of retry interval is 3000(ms) and you can modify this value by changing the RetryTaskTime shared.property. Enter the job-specific settings. Settings common to all job types include: Job Name Integration Name - The Integration Name should be unique across the tenant. This batch job is deployed - Uncheck to save the batch job settings but disable the batch job from running. Start At - Enter the scheduled date and time. If entered a past date and time, the batch job gets scheduled for the forthcoming recursive date and time. Repeat Every - (the period of time between runs, with a one day minimum) Priority - The priority of the batch job decides when to be picked from the pool of matured batch jobs. The batch job with the highest priority is 1, while the lowest priority is 5. For any batch job creation, the default priority is 1. If two or more batch jobs have the same priority within the pool of matured batch jobs, the batch job created first takes precedence. Notify Address Click Save.
