    <body>There are limits on the number of fields you can create per object definition. For instance, you cannot create more than 50 fields of Date or Date/Time type. Platform uses the single wide database table, RB_OBJ_DATA, to store all object records. That table has 50 columns of DATETIME type (in MySQL terms) named from DATE0 to DATE49. When a new field is created, one of these columns is assigned to that field to store data. If you are a Private Cloud customer and have full control over your database, you can increase limits on the number of fields. To add columns: Use an SQL script to create more columns of the selected type to the following tables: RB_OBJ_DATA (main data table) RB_DELETED_OBJS (records in Recycle Bin) RB_USER_DATA (Platform users) RB_CUST_DATA (customers) Make sure that the newly added columns follow the naming convention and use continuous numbering. For instance, you may create ten new Date/Time columns named DATE50, DATE51 to DATE59 Make sure these new columns are added to all databases. Add entries to Shared Properties to reflect the new limits on number of columns. Property Description Default Value MaxStrFields Maximum number of VARCHAR(100) fields (in MySQL notation) 200 MaxIntgFields Maximum number of BIGINT fields 150 MaxDblFields Maximum number of DECIMAL(20,8) fields 50 MaxTxtFields Maximum number of LONGTEXT fields 50 MaxDateFields Maximum number of DATETIME fields 50 After server restart, you should be able to create more Date or Date/Time type fields per object definition. Note: If system admin had configured extra fields via shared props : MaxIntgFields (5 such prop) etc Master Administrator is responsible for adding these new fields into all existing data tables in each of the database. Data Tables : RB_CUST_DATA, RB_USER_DATA, RB_DELETED_OBJS, RB_OBJ_DATA, RB_OBJ_DATA_xxxx (if available), Stored Procedure : createDedicatedTableWithIndexes</body>
