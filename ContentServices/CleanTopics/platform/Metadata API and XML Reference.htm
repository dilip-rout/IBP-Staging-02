    <body>The SOAP and REST methods in this section provide a way to manipulate the following Platform metadata elements: application, object, field, and relationship definitions. These calls either generate output in XML format or take input in XML format. The XML schema for these APIs is available at https://app.infiniteblue.com/webapi/wsdl/metadata.xsd Reviewers: my source didn't say whether order is important for the XML, does the XSD enforce order within an element or node? See the following topics for details: Metadata XML reference SOAP Metadata Methods REST Metadata Methods</body>
