    <body>Platform Private Cloud users can extend the native Platform capabilities by creating custom Java-based triggers, JSP pages and custom authentication methods. This topic explains how to develop and deploy these custom components in any Platform Private Cloud instance. Note: Platform uses Java 8. To develop a custom trigger, you must understand how Platform represents a trigger programmatically. A Platform trigger requires the following programmatic and configuration definitions: A design-time class (configurator) that extends the class com.rb.core.services.event.TriggerConfig. A runtime class that extends the class com.rb.core.services.event.RuntimeTrigger. An event node in the config/events.xml file that describes the trigger. Language translations of the trigger’s name and description in the res/lang_xx.properties resource file.</body>
