    <body>Event records include a notification, which sends an email notification when an event is added to the calendar. The email includes a link to the record's information in Platform. If logged in to Platform, users will also receive pop-up notifications when a meeting assigned to them is about to start. Timing for that notification is determined by the Pop-up Reminder field on a record. Reminders are displayed only once.</body>
