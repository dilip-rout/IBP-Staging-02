The resulting XML can be installed in other Platform tenants. The XML files for complex applications can be over 5MB. After the file is generated, choose Save or Save As to save a copy locally. Applications with errors will not generate XML. If this is the case, try creating an application tree , which will show you any components with errors. Options available when generating XML include the following: The version of the application to be exported as XML. This value is auto-incremented each time you generate new XML for the application.
