    <body>Purpose Runs an SQL SELECT query on the server and returns a single decimal value as the result. This is a simplified version of selectQuery() and is suitable for calculations such as finding a sum of values. The SELECT query used in this method consists of the following parts: The SELECT statement expects columns or expressions to be selected (mandatory). Use the field integration names as SQL column names. You can use expressions such as COUNT(1). You cannot use * to retrieve all columns. The FROM clause must consist of exactly one object name (mandatory). The WHERE clause can include a valid SQL expression to narrow the selection (optional). Use field integration names as SQL column names. The ORDER BY clause can include a valid SQL expression to order the selection (optional). Use field integration names as SQL column names. You can use special tokens in your queries such as: TODAY for current time WEEK for 12PM of last Sunday MONTH for 12PM of 1st day of current month QUARTER for 12PM of 1st day of current quarter YEAR for 12PM of 1st day of current year CURR_USER for id of currently logged in user Object and Field names are case-sensitive, while other components of the SQL query are not. Use #code suffix to fetch integration codes for picklist fields rather than IDs. See Adding business logic for more information. Syntax selectNumber(string sessionId, string query); Parameters sessionId A string containing the session ID obtained at log in. query A SQL SELECT query. See the examples described for selectQuery() . Output Single result of the SELECT query as a decimal number Permissions Required View permission for the requested object type. Example Double total = binding.selectNumber(sessionId, "SELECT SUM(amount) FROM customer WHERE name LIKE 'M%'");</body>
