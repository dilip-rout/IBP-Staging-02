    <body>The functions in this section allow you to set, retrieve, and remove custom user session data. Platform stores this data as key/value pairs and it is available for the duration of the user session. Custom user session data is useful when you want to visit multiple application pages and have each of those pages display data related to the same record or in the same context. For example, you might store the record name in a script component on a view page and retrieve it to filter the view in a script component on a record list page. You can use server-side APIs as well as client-side APIs to access the same user session data. See User session data API for information about server-side user session data APIs. Note: The user session data related APIs are not supported in portals.</body>
