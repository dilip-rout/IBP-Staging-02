Follow these steps to enable page tabs: Open the page editor on the page on which you want to enable tabs. Click the menu next to the page title and select Enable Tabs: The first tab, named Tab 0, and a button to add tabs will appear: Tabs are enabled for the page. When tabs are enabled, each section on the page is associated with a tab. The first tab, Tab 0, is associated with the first section of the page by default.
