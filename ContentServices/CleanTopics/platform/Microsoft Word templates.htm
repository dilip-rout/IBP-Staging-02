    <body>You can upload Microsoft Word documents (Only DOCX extension) and use them as Document Templates. The following graphic shows an example of a Microsoft Word document template, which includes tokens from a base record (Order) that includes a loop through related items. The body of the loop represents a Microsoft Word table with a single row: The graphic below shows the parsed template populated with real data. You can see that original tokens are replaced with actual values and the styles of the Microsoft Word document are preserved. The date field uses the date format configured in the current user's tenant. The loop through related records now includes a table row for each related record (under the Catalog Item column).</body>
