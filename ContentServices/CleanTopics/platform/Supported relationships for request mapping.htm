    <body>The following table describes supported mappings between Platform object fields and Corticon entities attributes and messages for different relationship cardinalities. In the table, Base object/Base entity is the top-level object/entity in the tree structure and Related objects/Associated entity is an object/entity with which the base object or entity has a relationship. Platform object Corticon entities Platform relationship Corticon relationship Supported Base object Base entity N/A N/A Yes Base object Associated entity N/A 1:1 or 1:M No Related object Base entity 1:1 N/A Yes Related object Base entity 1:M or M:M (Sends first related record value) N/A Yes Related object Associated entity 1:1 1:1 Yes Related object Associated entity 1:M or M:M 1:M Yes Related object Associated entity 1:M or M:M ( Sends first related record value) 1:1 Yes For mappings that involve relationships with multiple records on the Platform side single entities on the Corticon side, when the trigger executes, only values from the first related record will be sent in the request. For example, the following request mapping maps a field from the related object Order Line to the base entity Item. The relationship from Order to Order Line is one-to-many, so Platform only maps the value from the first Order Line record as described in the fourth row of the table.</body>
