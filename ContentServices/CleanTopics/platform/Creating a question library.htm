    <body>A question library saves a set of questions that can be used in multiple surveys. The questions library allows you to organize questions in categories and provides a default Generic category. You can create new categories and rename or delete existing categories. However, you can only delete categories that have no questions associated with them. Reviewers: I'll document the steps when we confirm the correct behavior.
