    <body>A user has all permissions assigned to that user's assigned role. In addition, you can assign individual permissions to a particular user. See User-based access control for more information. You can assign the following permissions by role: Permissions to access selected applications. If a particular role has access to an application, that role will be given default access to newly created components of that application unless you override this access. If a particular role does not have access to at least one application, and at least one tab in that application, a user with that role will not be able to log in to Platform. Permission to access object records, including view, create, edit and delete permissions per object type. Permission to view object fields in the user interface, and the ability to specify that a field is read-only in the user interface for particular roles. For API access, permissions for fields are determined by permissions for the object type. Permission to access views, tabs, charts, reports, and workflow actions. Permission to access menus, including submenus.

They can only create roles with the same set of permissions as their own role or with a subset of those permissions. They cannot manage the Administrator role or their own role. They cannot assign any administrative permissions to any role.

If no permission is granted, the password field value is returned as Password on File. This permission can’t be granted to non-administrative system roles – Portal User and Portal Guest. This permission does not apply to Server Side APIs or field tokens used in template/trigger body. They always return password as plain-text value.
