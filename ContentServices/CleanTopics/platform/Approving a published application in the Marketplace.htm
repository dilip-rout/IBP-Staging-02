    <body>In hosted Platform, Infinite Blue is the administrator of the master tenant. So, your applications are published to the Marketplace after Infinite Blue approves them. In Platform Private Cloud, master administrators can review and choose to approve published applications to make it available in the Marketplace web page for Private Cloud installation. When a Private Cloud administrator submits a published application, the master administrator receives an email with a link to preview and approve it from the Marketplace application. Alternatively, the master administrator can execute these steps to approve and publish an application in the Marketplace: Open the Marketplace application from the application switcher. Click and open Published Applications from the application menu bar. The Published Apps page opens. In the Published Applications grid, under the Published Application column, click the application's name that you want to approve and publish. The application’s view page opens. Select Edit. The application’s edit page opens. Optionally, update the application properties set by the application submitter and click Marketplace Preview to see how the application page will appear on the Marketplace web page. Select the Approved check box and then click Update. The application is now available on the Marketplace web page and the application publisher is notified through an email.</body>
