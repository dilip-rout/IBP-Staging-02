    <body>In a search query, you can escape the following characters so that the search interprets them literally instead of as operators: + - &amp;&amp; || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ / To escape these characters, use the backslash (\) before the character. For example, to search for (1+1):2, use the query: \(1\+1\)\:2</body>
