    <body>Record Creator is a system role Platform assigns when a new record is created. This role allows you to set permissions by object type for users who create records. Because the Record Creator role only applies to object records, it only appears when you are creating and editing object definitions. You set Record Creator permissions in the Permissions section when editing an object. The Record Creator role only applies to a user who creates a specific record of that object type; for all other access, the user retains its normal role. Consider the following example: Users of your Customer Service application (for this example, user accounts with the Service Customer role) can create Support Request records, as well as browse and manage a list of their own requests. To achieve this access, set the following permissions on the Support Request object: Service Customer role: Create only Record Creator role: View, Edit, and Delete Users with the Service Customer role can create Support Request records, but cannot view, edit, or delete Support Request records. However, once they create a record, they have permission to view, edit, and delete it through the permissions granted to the Record Creator role. This ensures that Service Customers can view and edit only their own support cases.</body>
