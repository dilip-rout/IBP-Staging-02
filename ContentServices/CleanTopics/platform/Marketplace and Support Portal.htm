    <body>Your Platform customers can publish their applications to the Marketplace. See Using the Infinite Blue Platform Marketplace for more information. Publishing an application will create a Published Application record in the System Console. The administrator of the master tenant manages this process by monitoring and updating Published Application records. Apart from the fields which can be selected by the publisher, as an administrator in the master tenant, you can set the following fields: Check Is System only if this application explicitly includes the User object. Infinite Blue recommends that you create your own system application that includes the User object (similar to the Platform application) and publish it from a dedicated tenant. Check Approved to allow this application to be installed by any user browsing the Marketplace. Your customers can send feedback and report issues through the Help &gt; Support Tickets menu. This will create a Support Request record in your master tenant Support Center application. You can use an existing workflow, or create your own actions to process these requests.</body>
