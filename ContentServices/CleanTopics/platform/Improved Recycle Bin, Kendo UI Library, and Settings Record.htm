    <body>This topic describes the following new features and changes: Alternative way to open Recycle Bin Ability to populate existing records with default value of new field Cannot create or delete a Settings record Support for enabling native date/time/date-time controls restricted to mobile devices Updated Kendo UI library Alternative way to open Recycle Bin The Recycle Bin screen supports purging or restoring of deleted items. For Administrators, the bin shows all items deleted in the tenant, for users with other roles, it only contains the items they personally deleted. By default, it has been available from the Platform menu. However, administrators could use a custom client-side script to hide it. In this release Administrators can additionally show or hide the bin by user Role. If the Recycle Bin is available for their role, users can now access it from the My Profile option on the profile menu, which opens the My Profile screen: Ability to populate existing records with default value of new field When creating a new field with a default value, you can now select an option to populate existing records with that default value. This option is available for the following field types: Text Checkbox Currency Decimal Integer Percentage Version Number Picklist Picklist (Multi-Select) Radio Buttons Group of Checkboxes To select the option, assign a Default Value to the field and select the Assign values for all existing object records now check box when creating the field as shown below. Note: The setting only applies to new fields. If you update an existing field by adding a default value, existing records will not be updated with the Default Value. Cannot create or delete a Settings record A Settings object is available to administrators from Setup &gt; Administration Setup &gt; Account Administration. This was intended to be a singleton object, since it stores tenant-wide settings. In this release, Platform enforces the restriction so that exactly one Settings record exists in a tenant. An attempt to create or delete a Settings record will fail. For example, suppose you add the following script to an application page: &lt;script&gt; function my_callback(id) { console.log("new record ID is: " + id); } rbf_createRecord("$SETTINGS", {"id":66778899}, my_callback); &lt;/script&gt; Executing the script results in the following notification: Attempting to delete the Settings record results in the following notification: Support for enabling native date/time/date-time controls restricted to mobile devices The application setting Use Native Calendar and Time Control has been changed to Use Native Calendar and Time Control on mobile devices and only applies to mobile devices. Desktop devices use the Kendo UI controls, which render and function better than native browser controls.
