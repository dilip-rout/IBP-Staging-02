    <body>In private cloud installations application submitters can add the Test Drive capability to Marketplace. With test drive enabled, users can preview application functionality in read-only mode without logging in. When users test drive an application, they access it with the Portal User role. In Test Drive mode, users cannot create or modify data records. Make sure the application contains some meaningful sample data. To enable Test Drive for an application, an administrator must first create a new tenant where the specific application is installed. Once the tenant is available, edit the application definition and set permissions for the Portal User user role to access tabs and objects. When the application is ready, the private cloud administrator must edit the Published Application record and assign that customer tenant as the Test Drive tenant.</body>
