    <body>You can tailor tabs, page sections, views, and buttons to specify the devices on which they will be visible. Each of these components has a property, Show In, which lets you select the devices on which you want them to appear. Tabs The following screen shows this property for a tab. You can select or deselect desktop, tablet, and smart phone. The list of tabs for an application shows the settings for this property in the Show In column: Page Sections You can specify on which devices a page section is visible by editing the Show In property for that section in the page editor: Views When creating or editing a view, you can select the devices on which a view is available by selecting devices in the Show In property: The table of views for an object definition has a Show In column that displays the devices selected for each view. Buttons When you create or edit a button for an object, you can select the devices on which it will be visible in the Show In property: The Show In property is displayed in the table of buttons in the object definition. See Using buttons on pages for more information about buttons. Note: By default, the page-level tabs on New/Edit pages do not display the Show In property. As the Menu and Page-level tabs on Record View page display data without any validation or actions while the New/Edit pages requires data which needs to be filled, validated and submitted as a form. Thus, the Show in property is not available for New/Edit pages.</body>
