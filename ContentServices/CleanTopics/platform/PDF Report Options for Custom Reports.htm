    <body>When creating or editing a custom report, you can specify if a report must be rendered as a PDF document. Only reports rendered as PDF documents can contain a table of contents. See Section Types for details. To configure PDF properties for a custom report: From the Reports section of an object definition page, do one of the following: Create a new report (see Selecting a Custom Report Type ), select a custom report type, and click Next. Open an existing custom report. In the Report Properties window: Click the Render as PDF check box. The PDF Options section appears with the following options: Page Size — Specifies the size of a PDF page. The default page size is Letter. Options include all PD4ML-supported sizes as well as custom sizing. Page WIdth(in inches) — Specifies the width of a page when custom page sizing is selected. Page Height(in inches) — Specifies the height of a page when custom page sizing is selected. Page Orientation — Specifies the orientation of a PDF page (Portrait and Landscape). Portrait is the default value. Page Margins (mm) — Specifies the Top, Right, Bottom, and Left margins in mm. Page Numbers — When turned on, page number format, positioning (to be displayed in header or footer), and alignment can be specified. Note: You can choose to custom format page number using tokens from the header/footer section properties. However, you must ensure that the Page Numbers report property is turned off to avoid page number duplication. Pages to skip (Header) — Allows a certain number of initial pages to not have a header. This is useful when you do not want a header on cover pages, prefaces, etc. Note that you need to tune this property based on the content generated and is useful only if you know how many pages these initial sections are going to occupy. Pages to skip (Footer) — Allows a certain number of initial pages to not have a footer. This is useful when you do not want a footer on cover pages, prefaces, etc. Note that you need to tune this property based on the content generated and is useful only if you know how many pages these initial sections are going to occupy. Smart table break — When selected, it switches on/off the table break feature. If set to true, it inserts page breaks in between table rows to fit the table as per the PDF page height. If the table has a header, the header row that span pages will be reproduced on each page. Note: This does not support nested tables and multi-page rowspans. Enable hyperlinks — When selected, hyperlinks are enabled in the PDF document. When you run the report, it will be rendered as a PDF document with the specified properties.</body>
