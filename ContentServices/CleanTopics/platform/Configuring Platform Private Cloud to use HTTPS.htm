    <body>By default, access to Platform Private Cloud from outside of a firewall uses the HTTP protocol. You can configure it to use HTTPS instead. The procedure differs depending on whether you are using the evaluation version or a licensed version of the product. If you are using the evaluation version of the product: Go to System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties &gt; General &gt; Platform. Change the value of HostName to localhost:8831 (for PAS) or to localhost 8081 (for Tomcat). Note that these are the default port numbers for PAS and Tomcat. If you have changed the HTTPS port number for your configuration, use that number instead. Save to restart the server for the changes to take effect. If you are using a licensed version of the product: In System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties &gt; General &gt; Security enable IsSecureServer . Save to restart the server for the changes to take effect.</body>
