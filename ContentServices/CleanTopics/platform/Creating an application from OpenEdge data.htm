    <body>You can create the foundation data model for a Platform application (multiple objects) with data from OpenEdge Object Services. You do this by specifying an OpenEdge Data Service Catalog file and an OpenEdge URI when you create the application. To create a Platform application from an OpenEdge Object Service: Do one of the following: From an application page: Select New Application from the Platform menu. From a setup page: Click New Application on the sidebar. Select Create from External Data. The Import Application Metadata page opens. Select OpenEdge Service and click Next. The Import an Application from OpenEdge Services page opens. Specify the following: If you are using Hosted Platform: OpenEdge JSDO Catalog — The OpenEdge Data Service Catalog file. Infinite Blue recommends that you refer to the Enabling support for filtering options and sorting to learn what a Data Service Catalog must include to fully use Platform functionality. Service URI — The URI for the Web application where the OpenEdge Data Object Service is deployed No Authentication — Specifies that no login credentials are required to access the service URI Basic Authentication — Specifies that the login credentials you create be used to access the service URI. If you select this option, you must specify the Login Name and Password you want to use to access Platform. If you are using Platform Private Cloud: OpenEdge JSDO Catalog — The OpenEdge Data Service Catalog file. Infinite Blue recommends that you refer to the Enabling support for filtering options and sorting to learn what a Data Service Catalog must include to fully use Platform functionality. Service URI — The URI for the Web application where the OpenEdge Data Object Service is deployed No Authentication — Specifies that no login credentials are required to access the service URI Use Current User (if OpenEdge Authentication is enabled) — Specifies that OpenEdge credentials are required to access the service URI. This is the default option for users accessing Platform using OpenEdge credentials and this option is not available for non-OpenEdge users. Note: If the OpenEdge service is configured with single point authentication, Platform must also have OpenEdge authentication configured for it, and as a prerequisite, you (a Private Cloud user) must copy a set of JAR files from the OpenEdge library to the Platform library. For details on how to implement OpenEdge authentication in Platform, see Configuring OpenEdge Authentication . Basic Authentication: Specifies that the login credentials you create be used to access the service URI. If you select this option, you must specify Login Name and Password of your choice that you want to use to access Platform. Click Next. The Import an Application from OpenEdge Services page is updated to show the components defined in the OpenEdge JSDO Catalog. Select the objects you want to import and click Next. The Import an Application from OpenEdge Services page is updated to show the application's details. The default values for the application and object names are inferred from the OpenEdge JSDO Catalog. Select Do you want to create a new Tab for the object now to add a tab for your object and Service object support complex filter and sorting to enable sorting and filtering of fields when viewing application data. Accept the default values or modify them as per your requirements. Note: For each object you create, you must have only one field specified as the Record Name field, and for each object that you create, specify the fields that should be used as the Primary Key. Neglecting this step will mean that some Platform capabilities that rely on finding triggers or related objects cannot be used. Click Create. The application is created and added to the list of existing application.</body>
