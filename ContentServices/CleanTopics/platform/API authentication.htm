    <body>When logging into Platform using REST and SOAP login APIs, three mechanisms for authentication are supported: The authentication mechanism itself — Password for Password authentication, LDAP for LDAP authentication, etc. Some authentication methods, such as Kerberos and SAML, do not support this mechanism. API token authentication mechanism— A user can generate an API token to use instead of a password for authentication. OpenEdge and Custom authentication methods do not support this mechanism. See Change API Credential for information about generating API tokens. Custom authentication — Authenticates the login API call via custom authentication logic. You can set the API authentication mechanism for all tenants using the control panel property API Authentication. See Control Panel for details.</body>
