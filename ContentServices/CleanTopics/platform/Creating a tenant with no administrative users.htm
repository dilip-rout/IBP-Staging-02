    <body>You can create a customer tenant with no administrative users and assign certain administrative permissions to non-administrative roles. While administrators on the master tenant can log into the tenant to perform administrative tasks, users with non-administrative roles can perform most day-to-day tasks. Follow these steps to create a tenant with no administrative users: Set the value of the shared property AllowAdminLessTenant to true. See Shared Properties for details. Create a custom role and assign it some administrative permissions, such as Manage Users and Manage Roles. See Roles and permissions for a list of administrative permissions you can grant to a non-administrative roles. Note: Ensure that the created role is associated with an Integration Code. Select at least one application to be installed during customer creation and attach the role to the application. For that application, create a Post Customer Create Script that changes the role of the first user from Administrator to the role you created and attached. For example: var objId = rbv_api.selectNumber("SELECT id FROM USER where role =90");
var role = rbv_api.stringToJson(rbv_api.getRoleById("868114"));
rbv_api.setFieldValue("USER",objId,"role",role.code); See Post install scripts for more information. Follow the steps in Creating a new customer record to create the customer tenant, selecting the application with the Post Customer Create Script to be installed during customer creation. The user whose email you enter when creating the customer will now have the custom role instead of the Administrator role.</body>
