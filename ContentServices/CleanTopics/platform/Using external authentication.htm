    <body>Instead of verifying passwords stored in Platform database, the system can perform an external call to verify an existing Platform user's password. The following graphic illustrates the process: If external authentication is set up, Platform is no longer managing users' passwords. In this case, the Change My Password link is disabled. We strongly recommend that you modify the email template which welcomes new users to clearly indicate the selected authentication method.</body>
