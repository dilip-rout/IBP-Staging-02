    <body>This file stores system-level properties to be shared among all Platform components. Each property is placed on a separate line in the following format: key = value The table below lists all available properties and their default values. A few important properties to note: The HostName property defaults to localhost:8080 To use a different host name or port, adjust this property accordingly, or your server will not start. Access the Shared Properties tab from the Application Switcher &gt; System Console &gt; System. From the Application Switcher &gt; System Console &gt; System &gt; Shared Properties &gt; General &gt; Platform define, modify or view the below properties Platform Property Description HostName Host name of your master server. Default for Tomcat: localhost:8080 Default for PAS: localhost:8830 To use HTTPS for access, the default port numbers are 8081 and 8831, respectively. Note: This property appears as a Platform property for a Platform instance that has no licensing information and needs a restart. For a licensed Platform instance, the HostName appears in the Control Panel &gt; General &gt; License and Usage TitleTemplate The template for a page's title. Can be overridden by ISV partners. See Creating and managing customer tenants for more information. Default:{!A} | {!S} | {!P} DefaultLangCode ISO language code used by default (when no language selection is made or available) Default: en (English) DefaultDateFormat Index of date/time format used when no selection is made or available, use a type supported by Platform Default: US date/time format TimeZones A comma-separated list of time zones. If required, add to this list any TimeZone IDs which are a part of TimeZone.getAvailableIDs(). Default: None Encodings Encoding support for comma-separated list files. Default: ISO-8859-1,US-ASCII,UTF-8 CustWeight The coefficient to be used in a formula to calculate load on a particular production server (only used in multi-server edition). Defaults to 3. HazelcastBackupCount The number of synchronous backup copies made for master/prod data cache entries across other members of the master/prod cluster members. Maximum value for this map can be set to 3. Set this to zero if performance is a priority and no backup is required. Default: 1 HazelcastGlobalBackupCount The number of synchronous backup copies made for global cache entries across other members of the global cluster members. Maximum value for this map can be set to 6. Set this to zero if performance is a priority and no backup is required. Default: 1 CustomClassFilter You can use custom Java objects (available on CLASSPATH) in Platform formulas. This property lets you specify the classes to allow in formulas. Specify a RegEx expression that matches classes you want to allow. For example, if you want to use a variable of the type java.util.ArrayList(), you would include the entry CustomClassFilter=java.util.ArrayList. See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp for more information about RegEx expressions. JSOptimizationLevel Optimization makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program. Simple data and type flow analysis is performed to determine which JavaScript variables can be allocated to Java VM registers, and which variables are used only as Numbers. Local common sub-expressions are collapsed (currently this only happens for property lookup, but in the future more expressions may be optimized). All local variables and parameters are allocated to Java VM registers. Function call targets are speculatively pre-cached (based on the name used in the source) so that dispatching can be direct, pending runtime confirmation of the actual target. Arguments are passed as Object/Number pairs to reduce conversion overhead. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino/Optimization for detailed information. UnloadCustAfterMins Unloads the customer from the cache after period of time (in minutes) Default: 60 CloudType When set to AWS the cloud instance type information is retrieved and displyed in System Console &gt; Servers Tab.

Default: true AppInstallOverridesChanges At customer tenant creation, controls whether conflicting application changes will be ignored or will override the existing component. The Customer record contains a list of applications that Platform will install automatically. These applications are installed in the order in which they appear in that list.
