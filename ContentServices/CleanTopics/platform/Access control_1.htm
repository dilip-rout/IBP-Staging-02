    <body>Since the client-side API gives users (or portal users) access to underlying data, functions that access and modify the data are subjected to access permissions. If the current user does not have sufficient permissions, the API call will fail. See Security and access control for more information about access control and permissions. See Client-side AJAX API for the available APIs and permissions required for each.</body>
