    <body>Page tabs visually separate components on pages. They are different from application tabs. Application tabs appear on the application menu bar, while page tabs are components of an application page and are associated with page sections. The record View page that Platform creates for you, has tabs. You can add tabs or rearrange them and you can specify which device(s) they render on. It is also possible to add tabs to New record and Edit record pages, but you must enable tabs on the page first. The example below shows a record View page with the tabs Platform creates by default, Title Info and System Info.</body>
