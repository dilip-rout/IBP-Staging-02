    <body>Platform uses JavaScript objects to represent certain aspects of the user interface and environment in which it is running. Each object described in this section can be accessed via a client-side AJAX API as indicated. You can use these objects in client-side scripts. Note: The methods in this section apply to the new UI, not the classic UI. Most Platform tenants are using the new UI. However, tenants on older Private Cloud installations might still be using the classic UI. These methods are not supported in portals.</body>
