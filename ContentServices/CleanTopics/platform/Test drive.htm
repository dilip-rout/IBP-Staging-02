    <body>You can set up dedicated customer tenants to provide test drive functionality for a particular application. To do that: Publish the application to the Applications Directory or Marketplace and make it available using the Publish button on the application view page. Note: publishing is only available for the original application creator. Publishing will create a record in Published Apps tab in the System Console. Edit that record and: Check the Approved box. Select the Customer where the published application was developed in the Test Drive lookup. Verify that your published application appears on the Applications Directory or Marketplace portal. Go back to the dedicated Customer and assign permissions for the Portal User user role. Infinite Blue recommends that you assign complete permissions for the Test Drive application. Create a set of records to demonstrate functionality of your application. Only these records will be available for a Test Drive visitor. Make sure that the Test Drive field is added to the View Application page on the Application Directory or Marketplace portal. You can also edit properties of the Test Drive field. Open the Application Directory portal or Marketplace and locate the published application. On the view page, you will see a Test Drive button. If the Test Drive button is configured correctly, this button will be enabled. When a visitor to the Applications Directory portal or Marketplace clicks that button, they will be redirected into designated tenant without logging in. The visitor will have access to all tabs and objects according to permissions assigned to the Portal User role. The visitor will not be able to: Access administrative functions. Modify any data. Send emails, run import, etc.</body>
