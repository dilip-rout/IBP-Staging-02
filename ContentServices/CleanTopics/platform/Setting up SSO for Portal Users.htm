    <body>Single-Sign On (SSO) uses SAML based authentication for logging users into applications. Infinite Blue Platform now enables using SSO for Portal Users and User objects. This allows seamless transition of a user from application to portal and vice-verse, thus trim down the effort of authenticating at multiple instances in multiple scenarios. Do the following to set up SSO for Portal Users: Navigate to Portals from the Application Setup pane. You can either Create a New Portal or Select an existing Portal to setup SSO. In the Portal View page, Click New Page. Either wise, Select an existing Login Page and then click Properties. For a New Page, select Page Type as Login Form &amp; Object Type as required. For SAML authentication, create a profile or use any existing profiles to employ SSO for login. For information on SAML Authentication, see Configuring SAML/ADFS Authentication for a Tenant . Ignore, if using Password as authentication mode. Once configured, click the Login Page link to get redirected to the IDP Login Page. To allow IDP initiated login, use the SAML Login URL. On successful authentication, you get redirected to the portal landing page. Note: If a portal is attached to any application, ensure the SAML authentication profile is also attached while exporting the application. If Global Authentication is set as an authentication mode, Portal Single-Sign On is not allowed on the tenant.</body>
