    <body>Private Cloud customers can develop and deploy a custom authenticator as an alternative to authentication methods provided by Platform. Custom authentication is an authentication profile configured by the master tenant using the control panel. This authentication profile is common across all tenants and there can be only one Custom authentication profile. Java Class for the Custom Authenticator To create a custom authenticator: Create a Java class that implements the com.rb.util.interfaces.IAuthenticator interface. At minimum three methods must be implemented: A no-arguments constructor A method that will authenticate users by login name, password (which is passed from the login page) and IP address, which returns true for success and false otherwise: public boolean authenticate(ICustomer cust, String loginName, String password, String ipAddress) throws Exception String representation (to be used by UI): public String toString() Compile this custom authenticator class into a JAR file. Copy the JAR file to the TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory. For a simple example, see CustomAuth.java included with the development kit customt.zip\customt\src\auth\CustomAuth.java. To make Platform aware of the authentication option: Set CustomAuthClass in System Console → System → Control Panel → Cnfiguration -&gt; Authentication → Custom section Using a Custom Authenticator Once you have completed the steps to create the Java and configuration classes, your custom authenticator is a choice in the Administration Setup &gt; Authentication page. Select your custom authenticator, and then save the changes. Your custom authenticator will be used to verify user credentials during login.</body>
