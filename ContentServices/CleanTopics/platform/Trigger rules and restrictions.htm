    <body>Triggers can work in combination. One trigger might invoke or rely on the results of other triggers. The following rules ensure that dependencies between triggers do not result in endless recursion: The total number of triggers invoked in a single update, create, or delete operation is limited to 100 for immediate triggers and 20 for delayed triggers (these numbers may vary for Private Cloud customers). Per triggering event, the same group of triggers, for example, those timed to occur after an update, will not run twice on the same record. Per triggering event, each trigger only runs once on each record. Total execution time for a group of triggers, such as those timed to occur on create, cannot exceed 30 seconds (this limit may vary for Private Cloud customers). Time of HTTP calls (POST and GET) is excluded from this limit. The trigger will be executed only if the user has either selected &lt;Any Update&gt; or a list of fields denoting if any of that particular field is changed, the trigger will be executed. Anyhow the list of fields is ensured by a maximum selection limit which is governed by Max Field limit denoting On-Field Change property the administrative preferences. Use the trigger debugger to verify that grouped triggers work as you expect. See Debugging complex triggers for more details.</body>
