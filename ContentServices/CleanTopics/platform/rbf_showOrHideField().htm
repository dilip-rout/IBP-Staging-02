    <body>Warning: Support for using this method with external objects (such as those mapped to external tables, to OpenEdge Service objects, or through a HDP connection) is a beta feature. This method is supported in production systems, except for external objects. Purpose This function shows or hides a field and its label. It will have no effect if the field is not shown on the page. On view pages, this API can be used in the page’s onLoad script; on edit pages, it can be used in any event handling code. Syntax rbf_showOrHideField(fieldName, showField, doNotHideResponsiveColumn) Parameters fieldName The integration name of the field showField If true, show the field and its label. If false, hide the field and its label. doNotHideResponsiveColumn Optional. If true, Platform hides only the value of the field, not the column itself. The column for the hidden field maintains its position regardless of the screen size. If false, Platform hides both the value of the field and its column. The value in the next column will take its position. Defaults to false. Note: This API is supported in portals as well. Examples The following examples show the behavior resulting from different options for showOrHideField(). In these examples, the view page is configured for four columns. The field to show or hide is Status (with the integration name t_status): Result of showOrHideField("t_status", true): Result of showOrHideField("t_status", false, true). The field's position is maintained in the row: Result of showOrHideField("t_status", false, false). The other fields in the row shift left, while the following rows remain the same: Result of showOrHideField("t_status", true) on a narrower screen, where the four columns have collapsed to two columns: Result of showOrHideField("t_status", false, false) with two columns. The other field in the row, Tags, shifts left, while the following rows remain the same:</body>
