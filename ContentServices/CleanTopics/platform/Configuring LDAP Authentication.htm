    <body>If you chose LDAP as the authentication method while Creating an Authentication Profile , specify the following values to configure Platform to authenticate users using your LDAP system. Default Setting: Selecting the Default UI or Default API fields indicate the authentication profile that is currently set as a default UI or default API authentication type. However, there is no compulsion that only one authentication profile should be the default for both the UI &amp; API authentications. Field Description Name Type an authentication profile name. Target URL The URL to access the LDAP system (typically, ldap://&lt;host-address&gt;) Security Authentication The authentication mechanism to implement. For example, for a Sun LDAP service provider, this can be one of the following strings: none, simple, or sasl_mech, where sasl_mech is a space-separated list of SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) mechanism names. The default value for this field is simple. Security Principal The name of the user or program doing the authentication. Typically this is a query string to search the LDAP database. Security Credentials The credentials of the user or program doing the authentication. Additional fields Any additional details required to set up an LDAP call. After specifying the above values, you must test your authentication method to check whether authentication succeeds. To test your authentication method: Under Test External Authentication, specify a valid login name and password. Click Test External Authentication. Note that you cannot save your changes until the test succeeds.</body>
