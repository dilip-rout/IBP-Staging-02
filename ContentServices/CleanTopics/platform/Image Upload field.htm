    <body>The Image Upload field type allows end- users to upload an image file attachment that is stored in the field. Pages that include the field will reference the images in an HTML &lt;img&gt; tag. An Image Upload field, offers the following properties to control the image size: It is unclear what the fields between the label and alternative text do. I've got a question out to dev. Before I added the new Maximum Image Size and revised the description of Max file size, this topic seemed to indicate that the height and width controlled the size of the image, but it was unclear how those settings interact with the new one and with the fact that Platform now renders adaptively. Field Properties Field Label — (mandatory) is displayed on the left from the field on view, edit, and new record pages. View Header — (optional) is used in headers of views and reports. If not specified, the Field Label is used. View Width — (optional) is used to set width (in pixels or %) of columns in views and reports. If not specified, the browser calculates the width of columns automatically. Default Size — The default size of the input field shown in forms (you can override this default as a page-level property using the page editor). Width in Pixels — Default width of HTML text area in Pixels. Height in Pixels — Default height of HTML text area in Pixels. Alternative text — The image &lt;alt&gt; tag, which defines tooltip text to display when a user hovers their mouse over the image. Maximum File Size — To limit storage space consumption, select a value to specify the maximum file size. For images over this size, Platform will automatically resize them on upload. Maximum Image Size — Platform resizes images larger than the specified value automatically. For landscape images, the maximum size (in pixels ) applies to the width. For portrait images, the maximum size applies to the height. When Maximum Image Size is specified, Platform ignores the Maximum File Size property. Advanced Field Properties — For more information, see Advanced field properties . Integration Name — The integration name is used to reference this field via merge fields or with Platform APIs. Field-Level Help — The Field-Level Help box allows you to define help text for the field that will appear in a popup when the user clicks the help icon next to the field. Image Upload and Shared Image fields are responsive by default. Responsive image fields change size to fit the current screen size. You can specify that an image field is not responsive on a particular page; see Responsive user interface for details. When an object definition contains multiple Image Upload fields, Platform groups the images into an image carousel. The carousel is rendered where the first image field is located on the page. The width of the carousel is based on the width of the cell in which the carousel is placed. By default, the height of the carousel is based on the first image's proportions. A carousel is responsive to the cell in which it is rendered on the page, keeping the proportions of the image. It is responsive even if the images are not responsive. See Responsive user interface for information about configuring image responsiveness and maximum width.</body>
