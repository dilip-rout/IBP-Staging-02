Data Maintenance for relationship field (M:1 and 1:1 cardinality) — This operation fixes data integrity issues pertaining to relationship and data records of the customer. This option is selected by default. Cleanup invalid relationship entries — This operation cleans up relationship entries from: RB_RELATIONSHIP table that does not have a valid relationship definition. RB_RELATIONSHIP table that does not have a valid object definition. RB_RELATIONSHIP table that is invalid. For every relationship record in RB_RELATIONSHIP table, invalid entries are determined by checking the data tables RB_CUST_DATA, RB_USER_DATA, RB_OBJ_DATA, and RB_DELETED_OBJS. This operation is done in batches as RB_RELATIONSHIP table may contain lots of relationship records. Recalculate all Expression Fields — This operation recalculates all expression field for all data records from its object definition present on the customer tenant. Note: To exhaustively capture operations run on a tenant, two new tenant level logs dataMaintenance.log and dataMaintenance_deletedRels.log are added. The latter captures only the details of what has been deleted. Click Submit to initiate the data maintenance job. A success message is displayed for the same.</body>
