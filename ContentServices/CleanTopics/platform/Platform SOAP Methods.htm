    <body>Many of the topics in this section include code samples written in Java using the Axis package. Platform SOAP API WSDL The Platform SOAP API WSDL is located at: https://app.infiniteblue.com/webapi/wsdl/api.wsdl . This link is available in Setup Home, under Applications Setup &gt; API. Platform uses Literal WSDL encoding. If your SOAP infrastructure does not support Literal WSDL encoding, consider using the REST API. Working with Field Data When working with records using the Platform SOAP API, you use a special container called DataField. This serves as a container for data stored in a single record field and includes the following attributes: Integration name (mandatory): Integration name of the field the data belongs to. Data value: the actual data that belongs to the field in this record, represented as string. The string format depends on the type of the given field: For check boxes: true or false, yes or no For numeric fields: a numeric value as decimal string For single picklists: the integration code of the selected item or item name For multi-select picklists: the integration codes of the selected items or item names separated by the "|" symbol For lookup fields: the numeric IDs or names (must be unique) of related records separated by the "|" symbol For date fields: a date string in the format corresponding to the current user's date format preference. Example: 05/01/2009 For date and time fields: a date-time string in the format corresponding to the current user's date format preference. The time zone for this string is the same as time zone selected in the current user's preferences. For example: 05/01/2009 1:00 PM is interpreted as 05/01/2009 1:00 PM PST, if the current user has the PST time zone setting. Permissions Most SOAP methods require the logged-in user to have the appropriate permission for the type of object used in the method call. For example, calling the the create() method to create a Customer record requires the logged-in user to have Create permission on the Customer object. The documentation for each method includes the required permissions. See SOAP Metadata Methods for information about SOAP metadata methods.</body>
