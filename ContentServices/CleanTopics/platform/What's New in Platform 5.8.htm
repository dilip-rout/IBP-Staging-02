If you are running on Platform 5.x.x.x, rest assured that you will be able to safely upgrade to any of the subsequent releases. Here is an overview of the new feature added recently to improve your Infinite Blue’s Platform experience: 1.

This feature uses authentication utilizing Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for logging users into applications. This would enable an effortless transition of a user from application to portal and vice versa, which hinders the need of authenticating multiple instances in numerous scenarios.
