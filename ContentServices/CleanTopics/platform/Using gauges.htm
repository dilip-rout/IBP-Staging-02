    <body>As with other UI components, you can use the page editor to add one or more gauge components to a section on a generic, object, or view page. There is no further configuration necessary to start viewing your computed data with professional looking gauges. You can place up to four gauges in a row in a single section. Using the controls above each gauge component, you can: Refresh a gauge component. Edit a gauge component. The administrative permission Manage Charts is required to create and modify gauges. Note: Avoid using the template #LOOP in a gauge's formula because it might lead to inefficient computations. Instead, try using group functions or the query API.
