    <body>The Permissions section on the application setup page allows you to manage permissions by user role and by individual users. Permissions set for a user override those set for roles, allowing fine-grained access control. In addition to permissions set at the application level, you can set relationship-based permissions and role-based field-level permissions. To set application permissions: On the application setup page, click Permissions in the ribbon below the application name or scroll down to the Permissions area of the page. Click Edit Permissions. A new page opens and displays the current permissions for user roles: If desired, click the check box for a user role to toggle its permission for the application. To set the application permission for a user, click Select User. A popup window opens and displays the users. You can navigate through the list of users or you can search for a particular user. Click the user for whom you want to set the application permission. The user appears in the table under Individual Users. Click the check box for the user to toggle its permission for the application. For information about managing application permissions and access control, see Security and access control .</body>
