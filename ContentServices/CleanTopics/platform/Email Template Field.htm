    <body>The Email Template Field type is a picklist that allows users to assign an email template to use with a specific Object record, similar to Document Template Field type. You can assign a default value to this Field and have this default value assigned to all existing records. This Field renders a link to preview the email template using the record's data. You can also use it in combination with a Send Email trigger and Send Email workflow action, see Triggers and workflows . Tip: Use Fields of this type when you want to allow users to select different types of email templates for different Object records. For example, you may allow your sales users to select a different Quote Template based on the type of order being created. Used with a Send Email trigger, you can automate an email based on the appropriate email template on an as-needed basis.</body>
