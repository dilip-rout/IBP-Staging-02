    <body>Under the terms of the Platform license you cannot reverse-engineer or modify the Platform software. You can, however, customize the appearance of your web pages by replacing standard Platform resource files (images, icons and CSS) with your own files. Each Infinite Blue Platform Private Cloud license is associated with a particular domain name, such as www.mycompany.com. You must purchase a new license to use a different domain name. Each Private Cloud license has an expiration date, after which Platform will no longer run. The expiration date includes a window of time to renew the license. Reviewers: Is the statement about a window of time to renew still valid? if so, how long is it? You can delete the license file to switch to the free evaluation edition. However, if you have more than two tenants, you will get a license error because a free evaluation only allows two tenants. For enterprise and ISV pricing or to purchase, see the contact information on our website.</body>
