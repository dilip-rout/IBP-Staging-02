    <body>The topics in this section explain how to manually install and configure Platform Private Cloud on a single server, such as: a dedicated in-house server, a third party server, a cloud infrastructure such as Amazon or Rackspace, or a laptop for testing. To use multiple Platform instances or auxiliary components, see Multi-server Environments . If the host on which you want to install Platform Private Cloud has a Windows or Linux operating system, using the installer instead of installing manually allows you to avoid a number of manual configuration tasks. Reviewers: Please note that we tried to test these manual installation and configuration steps and were *not* successful. Please review carefully. The high-level steps required to install manually include the following: Verify that Tomcat and the database you plan to use with Platform Private cloud are installed and configured as described in Using your own instance of Tomcat . Verify that Tomcat is stopped and not restarted until you finish all necessary steps for installing and configuring Platform. If you've installed Tomcat as a Windows service, run tomcat8w.exe to stop the service (or navigate to services to stop it manually). For Ubuntu Linux platform, run the shutdown.sh script. Download and unzip Platform components . Set environment variables . Edit the node-config.json file Run the Platform script for your database type . Start the runtime components and log into Platform .</body>
