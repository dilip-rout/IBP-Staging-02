    <body>You can create reports based on a document template. Document template reports are similar to document templates , except that reports are designed to present information on multiple records rather than a single record. To create a document template report, do the following: Create a new report by doing any of the following: Click New Report in the Reports tab in the default Platform application. Open an object definition, click Reports in the ribbon and click New Report. Open any page containing a section with a report link and click New Report in that section's header. Select an object to Report On and then select Document Template as your Report Type. Specify a Report Name and provide description if required. In the Report Name Template field, specify a name for a report template. As reports are not record specific, you can use date, month, and/or year tokens. If you do not input any value, the name of the report is used as the file name by default. Special characters are converted to underscore in file names. Note: You can see the document template report names reflected when you preview/run the report, send report emails, create new batch jobs, use report filters, and use report tokens in Document template. Define your report template using the template helper (see Document templates ). Select one of the supported report file formats: Microsoft Word (Only DOCX) Microsoft Excel (XLS and XLSX) HTML CSV XML Plain text (TXT) Optionally specify report filters for the object. For example, if you are generating a report on an object that stores your customer information, then you can apply a filter that direct Platform to include only customers from Asia in the report. Specify the access permissions (see Access control ). Click Save. Note: You can use an EVAL block to execute server-side JavaScript in document template reports.</body>
