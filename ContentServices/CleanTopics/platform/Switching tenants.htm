    <body>On hosted Platform, you can switch to a different tenant if you have an account on that tenant with the same email address. This is useful if your organization runs different applications on different tenants and you need to access those applications. To switch to a different tenant: From the user profile, menu, select Switch Tenant. This option is only available if you have an account on a different tenant. The Switch Tenant dialog opens. From the Switch Tenant dialog, select the tenant to which you want to switch. If you want this tenant to be your default tenant, click Make Selected As Default. Click Switch Tenant to switch to that tenant. You are now logged in to the other tenant.</body>
