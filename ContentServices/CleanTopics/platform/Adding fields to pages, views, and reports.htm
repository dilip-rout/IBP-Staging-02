    <body>Any time you create a new field, a dialog will prompt for the pages and views on which to add the field. You can add or remove existing fields from object pages or create new fields with the page editor. You can also edit views and reports to add, move, or remove fields from appearing in them. See Editing pages for more information. Note: To enable Object Type Attribute for Fields, see Extending Object with Object Types .</body>
