    <body>Hosted Platform customers receive an ISV account that allows tenant and application management. When the ISV account is created, you receive a welcome email from Platform that allows you to log in and start creating customer tenants. When you log in, you will want to view and modify your ISV accounts settings. And, you can change these settings at any time. However, note that once you have customer tenants that changes made to ISV account settings will not be applied immediately. Please contact Platform support if you need these to be activated within 24 hours. To view and modify your ISV settings: From the drop-down menu next to your profile avatar, select Update Profile. The Personal Setup page opens. Click My Settings to view or modify your settings. If you are a Private Cloud user, restart your servers for the recently modified changes to take effect. If you are a hosted Platform user, contact Platform Customer Support to update the ISV settings. In addition to the usual Platform user settings, you will see the ISV-specific options described in the table below. All fields are optional. Field Integration Name Description ISV System Name isvSysName The name of your company. This value will replace "Platform" throughout the platform. ISV Home Page isvHome The absolute URL to your website to use instead of infiniteblue.com. Note: When you set an ISV Home Page URL, Platform appends the privacy and terms Web page URLs to its footer. The privacy and terms Web page URLs created for your ISV Web page URL are &lt;ISV Home Page&gt;/privacy/ and &lt;ISV Home Page&gt;/terms/ respectively. Ensure that you host your privacy and terms Web page content in the aforementioned URLs. Note that, if the ISV Home page URL is not set or is not an absolute Web address, the privacy and terms pages do not appear in your Home page. ISV Login URL isvLoginUrl The URL to your custom login page ISV Copyright isvCopyright The copyright string to use at the bottom of all pages ISV Support URL isvSupportUrl The URL to "Support Requests" link to use instead of infiniteblue.com ISV Title Template isvTitleTemplate The template to use for the &lt;title&gt; tag in all pages The image is not required as there might be other ISV settings that can be made available in the mysettings page or only a select few can be made available for the user.</body>
