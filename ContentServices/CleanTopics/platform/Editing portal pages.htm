The portal page editor opens: Editing a portal page is similar to editing an application page. See Editing pages for more information. On the portal page editor, you can: Drag a new section from the left column onto the page. Drag an HTML component onto the page. See Adding an HTML component to a page for more information. Drag a script component onto the page. See Adding a script component to a page for more information. The script component can be an EVAL block; see Adding an EVAL block to a portal page for an example. Drag any of the components under Available Components onto the page. The available components vary depending on the page type and the object with which the page is associated, if any. In the above graphic, an Object View page is associated with the Title object. The page displays a Title and a link to the All Titles portal page. Add search forms. Pages with search forms require further configuration; see Portal page actions for details.
