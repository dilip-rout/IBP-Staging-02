Themes are only available in the Classic UI. For more information about themes, see Working with themes and Selecting a theme for a user for more information. General preferences PdfFontFamily: Add and configure more fonts to support different languages (For eg- Droid Sans Fallback for Chinese). You can update the value of this field with desired fonts. If a preferred font value is specified, it will be used to generate the pdf. Alternatively, if a preferred font value is not specified, then the value specified in the Shared Properties will be used. The font-family mentioned in this field is considered as the default font. Lato, Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma and sans-serif are available as default fonts. Global Search Default Application: By default, the global search is set to search within all objects. From the Global Search Default Application dropdown, select the application to be set as default to search the objects within. Once selected, the application is shown as default in the Global search filter drop down. See Application Search for more information. Show Pagination at Top: Shows a pagination control in the list view on the top for all users. This property is managed by the administrator.

See Trigger rules and restrictions for more information. Enable Quick Filtering: Enables the users to instantly filters the data using the fields in the list view of application runtime page. See Quick Filters for more information. Notifications Notify before session expiration:: You can configure whether session expiration notifications are sent at both the tenant and the user level. By default, the user settings is the same as the tenant setting. However, after you change the setting at the user level, that setting takes precedence for you; if an administrator changes the tenant setting, it has no effect on the user setting. The maximum inactive period after which a session will timeout and expire The maximum allowed session time after which a session expires and the user must re-login Tenant level — From Setup Home, click Preferences under Administration Setup. Notify before session expiration is selected by default. Deselect this to turn off notifications at the tenant level. User level — From the user profile menu, select My Profile and then select My Preferences. Notify before session expiration is selected by default. Deselect this to turn off notifications at the user level. On Platform Private Cloud, the default session times are configurable for each security level by modifying the following properties in the configuration file securityLevel.xml: inactiveSessionExpireMins loginSessionExpireMins See Built-in security levels for details. The method hasSessionExpired() returns true if the user session has expired and returns false if the user session has not expired. Note: This behavior is only available for users who are using the Classic UI. It is not available on setup and administrative pages. Notify on leaving a dirty form page: Select this option to configure so that Platform will notify you before a session expires and/or before leaving a dirty form (New, Edit) page: If either of these options is deselected, you will not receive that type of notification. Email Settings When an administrator adds a new user to a Platform tenant, Platform automatically sends a welcome email to the user's email address. A new tenant-level preference allows administrators to suppress welcome emails for new users, also known as silent onboarding. This preference is available on both hosted Platform and Platform Private Cloud. It is particularly useful for Private Cloud tenants that use SAML or Kerberos for authentication. Dynamic Image Resize Settings The smart image feature provides automatic resizing of images: Select Enable resizing and storing images for different device form factors to specify a maximum size in Image Upload field properties, so that Platform automatically resizes images when users upload them. Enable a dynamic image preference that causes Platform to automatically store images that are 992px or wider in four pre-defined widths (992px, 768px, 480px, and 50px) and to render the appropriate image. For example, on record list pages, Platform uses the smallest image, but for view pages and pages that display cards, Platform uses the image closest to but smaller than the device. The dynamic image preference applies to all apps in a tenant. Images narrrower than one or more of the pre-defined widths will be stored in the original size and the narrower widths. For example, an image with a width of 500px would be stored at 500, 480, and 50. To have Platform automatically resize images on upload, use the Image Upload field property Maximum Image Size and specify a value in pixels under Shared Properties &gt; Images. For landscape images, Platform applies the maximum size to the width. For portrait images, Platform applies the maximum size to the height. When Maximum Image Size is specified, Platform ignores the Maximum File Size property. Platform resizes images only if they are larger than the specified value. Note: When you set the field property or preference, it applies to images uploaded after the setting, not to previously stored images.
