    <body>Marketplace is the platform to publish and distribute applications. For more information about publishing and distributing applications using Marketplace, see Using the Infinite Blue Platform Marketplace . Installing an Application From the Platform Menu, select Install Applications. Browse the list of available applications to find the application you want to install. Click on application name for more information about the application, including whether a test drive is available, user reviews, and whether an application XML file is available for installing the application to your Private Cloud. If you want to test drive the application, and test drive is available, click Test Drive. The application opens, allowing you to try it out before installing it. Alternatively, click Install. The application is installed and you can start using it. Updating an Application To check for updates of an installed application: From the application switcher: To navigate to settings for the current application, click App Settings. To navigate to settings for a different application, hover your mouse pointer over the application and click the settings icon. If updates have been published and the version of the installed application is same for the currently published version, the Check for Updates option is not available. If updates have been published and the version of the installed application is lower than the currently published version, then Click Check for Updates. You are now redirected to Application's Marketplace page. Click Update. Select "Yes, update all components" to update the application with all components. Select "Only add new components and keep existing components unchanged" to update the applications by adding new components only and keep the existing components unchanged. Check "Override Permissions" to override the permissions updated in the latest version of the application to be updated on the destination tenant. If unchecked, changes from the publisher for existing role level permissions will be ignored. Some applications are marked as Managed, meaning that the publisher retains full control of the application's structure; you cannot customize any of its components. Only the publisher can customize managed applications. See Installing application updates for more information. Overriding Changes When installing updates from the Marketplace, note the Override Changes check box below the Install Updates button. For unlocked applications, this check box controls important behavior: If checked, Platform overwrites existing application components with those in the new application version. This happens for locked and partially locked applications regardless of whether this check box is checked. If unchecked, Platform only creates new application components and will not overwrite existing components to preserve any customizations made since the previous install or update. Note that locked and partially locked applications receive all updates for locked components, but unlocked components will not be modified. The following provide examples of how overriding works: If you created a portal and the updated application does not have a portal with the same name, your portal will not be overwritten, regardless of whether Override Changes is checked or not. If you added three fields to an object and Override Changes is checked and/or that object is locked by the application publisher, updating will override the object and your three fields will not be available. Any pages to which the fields were added will no longer show those fields.</body>
