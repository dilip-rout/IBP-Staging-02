    <body>Formerly, the Change My Password functionality was only available on the application end. We have now extended this functionality to the portal, thereby enabling portal visitors and users to change their passwords while being logged into the portal as well. A portal user (accounts created for objects with the Portal User attribute) can change their password based on the password requirements of the portal password authentication profile. A user (accounts created for your tenant as Platform User records) can change their password from the Change Password page only if Password Authentication profile is selected as the user’s API authentication profile. The Page Designer contains a Change Password link, that can be embedded onto any portal page. Clicking this link redirects the user to changing their password. To change their password, a user must enter the old password and the new password (twice, to verify). The new password must conform to the password requirements selected for the user’s tenant. For information about security and access control, see Portal security . For information on how to change your password on the application end, see Change My Password .</body>
