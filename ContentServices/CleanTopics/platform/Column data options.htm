    <body>You can change the way columns are displayed in a view on an application page in the following ways: Sorting — To sort a column, click the column header. Selecting columns — To select columns to display, select or deselect columns from the Columns menu. The selected columns for that view become part of the user's preferences and the view will contain the same columns for that user until the user changes the column selection. Moving columns — To move a column, drag the column header to a different location. The new column order is only valid for the current login session.</body>
