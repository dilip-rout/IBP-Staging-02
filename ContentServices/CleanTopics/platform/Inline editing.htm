    <body>Records in a view can be edited inline just like fields on view record pages. To edit a view record inline: Double-click a row to open the inline editing options available for that row. Enter new values for the row as desired. When you have finished editing the record, click save or cancel. You can choose to disable the inline editing option for the entire List View grid by selecting the Disable Inline Edit checkbox in Page Designer. The Disable Inline Edit option is disabled by default. This property is available for all record list views and related lists. It is applicable only for NewUI.</body>
