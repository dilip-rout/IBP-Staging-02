    <body>Platform supports integration with Microsoft Exchange. This integration is supported in the following ways: At the user level, you can configure your third party settings to: Send emails from your Exchange account. View your Exchange emails in applications. The Email tab in the Platform application will list the email messages in your inbox. You can also add an Incoming Emails component to an application page and view your email messages there. For example, you can create an Email tab for an application and place the Incoming Emails component on a generic page associated with that tab. Synchronize your Platform calendar to your Exchange calendar (this is a one-way synch from Platform to Exchange). Use of Microsoft Exchange for your email and/or calendar must be enabled at the tenant level. It is enabled by default. See My Third Party Settings for instructions on configuring user-level Microsoft Exchange settings. By default, Platform uses its own email server when sending administrative email messages from Platform. You can configure a tenant to use an Exchange email account instead. See Email server settings for instructions on configuring Platform to send administrative emails from an Exchange account. At the instance level, you can set shared properties to send administrative emails from an Exchange account. Set the following shared properties to use Exchange for administrative emails at the instance level: MailHost=Exchange MailUser= username@companyname.com MailPassword=myPassword See Shared Properties for more information.</body>
