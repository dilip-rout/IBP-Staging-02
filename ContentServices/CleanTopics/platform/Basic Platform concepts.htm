    <body>Platform enables development and deployment of browser-based Web apps. You first create the Web app. Platform browser-based Web applications consist of a set of configurable components. Core application components include objects, tabs and portals. Each of these core components contains sub-components like - fields, views, workflow, triggers etc. The process of creating a Web application in Platform involves defining core components and then building them out by adding and configuring sub-components. The Platform environment, whether hosted or Private Cloud, transparently handles the data storage for Platform Web applications. To provide a more specific mobile experience, you can: Take advantage of the Platform features that support multiple devices. Platform's responsive and adaptive UI adapts to display nicely on a variety of devices, and you can configure specific devices to render applications in a way that best suits each device. Expose the REST&#160;APIs , where you can quickly build modern mobile apps that access Platform data. See Supporting mobile users for more information on these options. Platform capabilities The Platform application development environment allows you to: Create an application data model by defining objects, fields, and relationships. Customize the user interface by modifying components such as pages, views, and templates, by adding custom icons and logos, and by selecting themes for applications. Define and customize workflow processes, statuses, and actions. Develop automated programmatic business logic such as with triggers. Generate and process template-based documents in MS Word, MS Excel, HTML, and plain text email formats. Enrich the user interface and workflow using client-side and server-side APIs. Use sophisticated full text search and filtering. Process data records using conversion mapping, comparison, parallel and sequential approvals, record queuing, multi-currency support, and other built-in functionality. Use built-in survey capabilities to create quizzes or questionnaires. Schedule triggers to automate data processing. Use the built-in calendar for task and event management. Define portals to create external facing applications that integrate with your Platform applications and seamlessly fit within existing websites and intranets. Secure your data using a number of authentication options and sophisticated access control. Enable integration with Google Apps: Gmail (outgoing and incoming), Spreadsheet, Calendar and Maps. Easily import your data and metadata from sources such as spreadsheets,
Progress OpenEdge services, and data exposed by Progress DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline or Microsoft Access. Easily migrate applications from Salesforce.com and the Force.com platform. Use REST APIs to access or modify application data. Publish, distribute, and install any application built using Platform. ISV Partners can create and manage customer tenants to run their own SaaS business.</body>
