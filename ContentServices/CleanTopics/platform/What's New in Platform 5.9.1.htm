    <body>This section includes the vital improvements within the Platform versions. Infinite Blue Platform 5.9.1.0 is complemented with few minor yet effective enhancements. In any case, you are operating on Platform 5.x.x.x, stay assured that you will be able to upgrade to any of the following releases reliably. The descriptions of new enhancements added are detailed below and substantial changes made to Infinite Blue Platform documentation in 5.9.1.0 release: 1.	API Key-based Authentication Platform REST APIs 2.0 now supports API token authentication. This enables you to create and view API key which is used by external applications to connect to the Platform APIs on behalf of your user account. These keys would permit you to execute operations (or have them executed on your behalf) that require authentication but for which you do not need to pass your actual password. The API key remains valid even if the user resets the password or until the user revokes or regenerates a new key. For more information, see API Key-Based Authentication . 2.	Base64 Encoding &amp; Decoding Infinite Blue Platform now facilitates encode and decode base64 strings as Server-Side APIs rbv_api.encodeBase64String and rbv_api.decodeBase64String respectively. These APIs now makes app development experience effortless and more robust where app developers need not write any custom JavaScript code for encoding and decoding string to Base64. 3.	Miscellaneous In the case of hierarchy relationships, it is possible to get child related records as well using the getRelatedRecord REST API 2.0. For more details, see getRelatedRecord .</body>
