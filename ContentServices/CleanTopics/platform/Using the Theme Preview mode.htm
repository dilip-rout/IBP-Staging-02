    <body>By default, application pages use the Default theme. The Theme Preview mode enables you to try out different themes and apply a theme that meets your requirements. There are two ways to use the Theme Preview mode: Administrators can change the look and feel of an application by applying a different theme. See Selecting a theme for an application for details.. All users, including non-administrative users, can select a theme to use for all applications, regardless of the theme chosen for each application by an administrator. See Selecting a theme for a user for details. Note: The capability for users to set theme preferences is enabled by default. An administrator can disable this capability by selecting Setup Home &gt; Preferences and deselecting the Allow users to set individual theme preference check box.</body>
