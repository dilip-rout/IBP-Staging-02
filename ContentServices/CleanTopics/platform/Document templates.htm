    <body>You can create Platform document templates by uploading text or binary files. Document templates can be used to generate documents such as quotes, purchase orders, reports, and invoices from the values in object records. Templates can contain content for languages that read right to left (RTL). See Right to left support in templates for details. Platform supports the following document formats for templates: Microsoft Word (Only DOCX) Microsoft Excel (XLS and XLSX) CSV HTML XML PDF forms Plain text (TXT) Document templates can be used in and with: Document Template fields; see Document Template Field for more information. Template Document workflow actions; see Workflow actions for more information. Workflow Triggers; see Change Workflow Status for more information. Template-based Reports; see Working with reports for more information. When modifying an existing text-based template (XML, TXT etc.) you have an option to edit text directly rather than uploading a new file. In this case, the Template Helper offers the following options: Helpers for available template tokens. Preview for JavaScript Hosted files. If you embed any formatting information, visible or invisible, inside the token, the parser will not be able to recognize the token. For example, {!name} is not recognized as a valid token and it is ignored. If you see that the parser cannot recognize your token (i.e. it does not get replaced), delete this token and type or paste it in again.</body>
