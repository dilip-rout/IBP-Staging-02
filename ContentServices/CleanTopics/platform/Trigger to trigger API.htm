    <body>The methods in this section are only for use with triggers. They allow you to share information among triggers. For example, the setSharedValue() and getSharedValue() allow storing results of calculations from one trigger and making them available for reuse in another trigger(s). Data can be stored only using these trigger methods while the current transaction to create, update, or delete a record is running. If you need another type of sharing, or application-level sharing rather than record-level, consider using company-wide settings, see Using company-wide settings .</body>
