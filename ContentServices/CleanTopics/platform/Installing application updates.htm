    <body>After installing an application, you might need to update it periodically to the most recent version from within the tenant (rather than pushing updates to all tenants from the master system). This can be done in one of two ways: If you installed the application from the Marketplace, click Check for Updates (option available only when newer version is available) in the application settings page. If a newer version exists, you will be prompted to Update it from the application directory. For details, see Installing and updating applications from the Marketplace App . If you installed an application directly from XML, obtain the new version of the Platform application XML file and install it from the application view page. For details, see Installing and updating applications from XML .</body>
