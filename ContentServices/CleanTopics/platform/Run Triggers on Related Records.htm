    <body>Typically, triggers do not invoke other triggers; however, some triggers offer an explicit option to do so. This trigger type allows you to explicitly invoke triggers with specified timing options on related records. To use this trigger, configure the following: The relationship between the current object and a target object (if the relationship is multiple, triggers will be invoked on multiple records). Either select a timing option on the target object to determine which triggers to invoke or explicitly select a group of related triggers to run: Note: If this trigger is used, Infinite Blue highly recommends using the trigger debugger to ensure expected results.
